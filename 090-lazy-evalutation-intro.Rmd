## Setup

The following packages are used in this chapter:
```{r chapter package list, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)
library(dbplyr)
require(knitr)
library(bookdown)
library(sqlpetr)
```
Start your `adventureworks` container:
```{r check on adventureworks}
sqlpetr::sp_docker_start("adventureworks")
```
Connect to the database:
```{r connect to postgresql}
con <- sqlpetr::sp_get_postgres_connection(
  user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
  dbname = "adventureworks",
  port = 5432, 
  seconds_to_test = 20, 
  connection_tab = TRUE
)
```

## R is lazy and comes with guardrails

By design, R is both a language and an interactive development environment (IDE).  As a language, R tries to be as efficient as possible.  As an IDE, R creates some guardrails to make it easy and safe to work with your data. For example `getOption("max.print")` prevents R from printing more rows of data than you want to handle in an interactive session, with a default of `r getOption("max.print")` lines, which may or may not suit you.

On the other hand SQL is a *"Structured Query Language (SQL): a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation."* ^[https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1245/structured-query-language-sql]. SQL has various database-specific Interactive Development Environments (IDEs), such as [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) for PostgreSQL.  Roger Peng explains in [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html#basic-features-of-r) that:

> R has maintained the original S philosophy, which is that it provides a language that is both useful for interactive work, but contains a powerful programming language for developing new tools. 

This is complicated when R interacts with SQL.  In a [vignette for dbplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbplyr/vignettes/dbplyr.html) Hadley Wickham explains:

> The most important difference between ordinary data frames and remote database queries is that your R code is translated into SQL and executed in the database on the remote server, not in R on your local machine. When working with databases, dplyr tries to be as lazy as possible:
> 
> * It never pulls data into R unless you explicitly ask for it.
> 
> * It delays doing any work until the last possible moment: it collects together everything you want to do and then sends it to the database in one step.
> 

Exactly when, which, and how much data is returned from the dbms is the topic of this chapter.  Exactly how the data is represented in the dbms and then translated to a data frame is discussed in the [DBI specification](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/vignettes/spec.html#_fetch_records_from_a_previously_executed_query_).

Eventually, if you are interacting with a dbms from R you will need to understand the differences between lazy loading, lazy evaluation, and lazy queries.

### Lazy loading

"*Lazy loading is always used for code in packages but is optional (selected by the package maintainer) for datasets in packages.*"^[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Lazy-loading]  Lazy loading means that the code for a particular function doesn't actually get loaded into memory until the last minute -- when it's actually being used.

### Lazy evaluation 

Essentially "Lazy evaluation is a programming strategy that allows a symbol to be evaluated only when needed." ^[https://colinfay.me/lazyeval/]  That means that lazy evaluation is about **symbols** such as function arguments ^[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#function-arguments] when they are evaluated. Tidy evaluation complicates lazy evaluation. ^[https://colinfay.me/tidyeval-1/]

### Lazy Queries

"*When you create a "lazy" query, you're creating a pointer to a set of conditions on the database, but the query isn't actually run and the data isn't actually loaded until you call "next" or some similar method to actually fetch the data and load it into an object.*" ^[https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-lazy-query]

## Lazy evaluation and lazy queries


When does a lazy query trigger data retrieval?  It depends on a lot of factors, as we explore below:

### Create a black box query for experimentation

Define the three tables discussed in the previous chapter to build a _black box_ query:
```{r}
sales_person_table <- tbl(con, in_schema("sales", "salesperson")) %>% 
  select(-rowguid) %>% 
  rename(sale_info_updated = modifieddate)

employee_table <- tbl(con, in_schema("humanresources", "employee")) %>% 
  select(-modifieddate, -rowguid)

person_table <- tbl(con, in_schema("person", "person")) %>% 
  select(-modifieddate, -rowguid)


```


Here is a typical string of `dplyr` verbs strung together with the magrittr `%>%` pipe command that will be used to tease out the several different behaviors that a lazy query has when passed to different R functions.  This query joins three connection objects into a query we'll call `Q`:

```{r}

Q <- sales_person_table %>%
  dplyr::left_join(employee_table, by = c("businessentityid" = "businessentityid")) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(person_table , by = c("businessentityid" = "businessentityid")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(firstname, lastname, salesytd, birthdate) 
```
The `str` function gives us a hint at how R is collecting information that can be used to construct and execute a query later on:
```{r}
str(Q, max.level = 2)

```

### Experiment overview
Think of `Q` as a black box for the moment.  The following examples will show how `Q` is interpreted differently by different functions. It's important to remember in the following discussion that the "**and then**" operator (`%>%`) actually wraps the subsequent code inside the preceding code so that `Q %>% print()` is equivalent to `print(Q)`.

The next chapter will discuss how to build queries and how to explore intermediate steps. But first, the following subsections provide a more detailed discussion of each row in the preceding table.

### Q %>% print(){#lazy_q_print}

Remember that `Q %>% print()` is equivalent to `print(Q)` and the same as just entering `Q` on the command line.  We use the magrittr pipe operator here, because chaining functions highlights how the same object behaves differently in each use.

```{r}
Q %>% print()
```
![](screenshots/green-check.png) R retrieves 10 observations and 3 columns.  In its role as IDE, R has provided nicely formatted output that is similar to what it prints for a tibble, with descriptive information about the dataset and each column:

> 
> # Source:   lazy query [?? x 4]
> # Database: postgres
> #   [postgres@localhost:5432/adventureworks]
>    firstname lastname     salesytd birthdate  

R has not determined how many rows are left to retrieve as it shows with `[?? x 4]` and `... with more rows` in the data summary. 

### Q %>% dplyr::as_tibble() {#lazy_q_as-tibble}

![](screenshots/green-check.png) ![](screenshots/green-check.png) In contrast to `print()`, the `as_tibble()` function causes R to download the whole table, using tibble's default of displaying only the first 10 rows.
```{r}
Q %>% dplyr::as_tibble()
```

### Q %>% head() {#lazy_q_head}

![](screenshots/green-check.png) The `head()` function is very similar to print but has a different "`max.print`" value.
```{r}
Q %>% head()
```

### Q %>% tail() {#lazy_q_tail}

![](screenshots/red-x.png) Produces an error, because `Q` does not hold all of the data, so it is not possible to list the last few items from the table:
```{r}
try(
  Q %>% tail(),
  silent = FALSE,
  outFile = stdout()
)
```

### Q %>% length() {#lazy_q_length}

![](screenshots/red-x.png) Because the `Q` object is relatively complex, using `str()` on it prints many lines.  You can glimpse what's going on with `length()`:
```{r}
Q %>% length()
```

### Q %>% str() {#lazy_q_str}

![](screenshots/red-x.png) Looking inside shows some of what's going on (three levels deep):
```{r}
Q %>% str(max.level = 3) 
```

### Q %>% nrow() {#lazy_q_nrow}

![](screenshots/red-x.png) Notice the difference between `nrow()` and `tally()`. The `nrow` functions returns `NA` and does not execute a query:
```{r}
Q %>% nrow()
```

### Q %>% dplyr::tally() {#lazy_q_tally}

![](screenshots/green-check.png) The `tally` function actually counts all the rows.
```{r}
Q %>% dplyr::tally()
```
The `nrow()` function knows that `Q` is a list.  On the other hand, the `tally()` function tells SQL to go count all the rows. Notice that `Q` results in 1,000 rows -- the same number of rows as `film`.

### Q %>% dplyr::collect(){#lazy_q_collect}

![](screenshots/green-check.png) The dplyr::[collect](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/compute.html) function triggers a call to the `DBI:dbFetch()` function behind the scenes, which forces R to download a specified number of rows:
```{r}
Q %>% dplyr::collect(n = 20)
Q %>% dplyr::collect(n = 20) %>% head()
```
The `dplyr::collect` function triggers the creation of a tibble and controls the number of rows that the DBMS sends to R.  Notice that `head` only prints 6 of the 20 rows that R has retrieved.

If you do not provide a value for the `n` argument, _all_ of the rows will be retrieved into your R workspace.

### Q %>% ggplot {#lazy_q_plot-categories}

Passing the `Q` object to `ggplot` executes the query and plots the result.
```{r}

Q %>% ggplot2::ggplot(aes(birthdate, salesytd)) + geom_point() 

```
* Rewrite previous query and this comment with adventureworks in mind.

Comment on the plot...

### Q %>% dplyr::show_query() {#lazy_q_show-query}

```{r}
Q %>% dplyr::show_query()

```
Hand-written SQL code to do the same job will probably look a lot nicer and could be more efficient, but functionally `dplyr` does the job.
## Disconnect from the database and stop Docker

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
sp_docker_stop("adventureworks")
```
