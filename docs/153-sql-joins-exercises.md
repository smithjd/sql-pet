# SQL Joins exercises {#chapter_sql-joins-exercises}

This chapter contains questions one may be curious about or asked about the DVD Rental business.

> The goal of the exercises is extracting useful or questionable insights from one or more tables. Each exercise has some or all of the following parts.
>
> 1. The question.
> 2. The tables used to answer the question.
> 3. A hidden SQL code block showing the desired output. Click the code button to see the SQL code.   
> 4. A table of derived values or renamed columns shown in the SQL block to facilitate replicating the desired dplyr solution.  Abbreviated column names are used to squeeze in more columns into the answer to reduce scrolling across the screen.
> 5. A replication section where you recreate the desired output using dplyr syntax.  Most columns come directly out of the tables.  Each replication code block has three commented function calls:
>    *  sp_tbl_descr('store')        --describes a table, store
>    *  sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')   --shows a table's primary and foreign keys
>    *  sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)  --shows table row counts.
> 6. To keep the exercises concentrated on the joins, all derived dates drop their timestamp.
>    *  SQL syntax:   date_column::DATE
>    *  Dplyr syntax: as.date(date_colun)

#  Exercise Instructions

1.  Manually execute all the code blocks up-to the "SQL Union Exercise."  
2.  Most of the exercises can be performed in any order.  
*  There are function exercises that create a function followed by another code block to call the function in the previous exercise.
3.  Use the Show Document Outline, CTL-Shift-O, to navigate to the different exercises.





Verify Docker is up and running:


```r
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```

```
## [1] "Docker is up, running these containers:"                                                                                                     
## [2] "CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES"    
## [3] "a03af9bf62c8        postgres-dvdrental   \"docker-entrypoint.s…\"   54 seconds ago      Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   sql-pet"
```

Verify pet DB is available, it may be stopped.


```r
sp_show_all_docker_containers()
```

```
## CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
## a03af9bf62c8        postgres-dvdrental   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   54 seconds ago      Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   sql-pet
```

Start up the `docker-pet` container


```r
sp_docker_start("sql-pet")
```

Now connect to the database with R


```r
# need to wait for Docker & Postgres to come up before connecting.

con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 30
)
```

# Dplyr tables

All the tables defined in the DVD Rental System will fit into memory which is rarely the case when working with a database.  Each table is loaded into an R object named TableName_table, via a DBI::dbReadTable call.

*  actor_table <- DBI::dbReadTable(con,"actor")


```r
source(here('book-src', 'dvdrental-table-declarations.R'),echo=FALSE)
```

The following code block deletes and inserts records into the different tables used in the exercises in this chpater.  The techniques used in this code block are discussed in detail in the appendix, ??add link here.??  


```r
source(file=here('book-src', 'sql_pet_data.R'),echo=FALSE)
```

# SQL Union Exercise

When joining many tables, it is helpful to have the number of rows from each table as an initial sanity check that the joins are returning a reasonable number of rows.

## 1.  How many rows are in each table?


```r
table_rows_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select *
                 from (      select 'actor' tbl_name,count(*) from actor 
                       union select 'category' tbl_name,count(*) from category
                       union select 'film' tbl_name,count(*) from film
                       union select 'film_actor' tbl_name,count(*) from film_actor
                       union select 'film_category' tbl_name,count(*) from film_category
                       union select 'language' tbl_name,count(*) from language
                       union select 'inventory' tbl_name,count(*) from inventory
                       union select 'rental' tbl_name,count(*) from rental
                       union select 'payment' tbl_name,count(*) from payment
                       union select 'staff' tbl_name,count(*) from staff
                       union select 'customer' tbl_name,count(*) from customer
                       union select 'address' tbl_name,count(*) from address
                       union select 'city' tbl_name,count(*) from city
                       union select 'country' tbl_name,count(*) from country
                       union select 'store' tbl_name,count(*) from store
                       ) counts
                  order by tbl_name
                 ;
                "
)
sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)
```

# Exercises

## 1. Where is the DVD Rental Business located?

To answer this question we look at the `store`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables to answer this question.


```r
store_locations_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select s.store_id
       ,a.address
       ,c.city
       ,a.district
       ,a.postal_code
       ,c2.country
       ,s.last_update
   from store s 
         join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id
         join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
         join country c2 on c.country_id = c2.country_id
")
sp_print_df(store_locations_sql)

### 2. List Each Store and the Staff Contact Information?

To answer this question we look at the `store`, `staff`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables.


```r
store_employees_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select st.store_id
       ,s.first_name
       ,s.last_name
       ,s.email
       ,a.phone
       ,a.address
       ,c.city
       ,a.district
       ,a.postal_code
       ,c2.country
   from store st left join staff s on st.manager_staff_id = s.staff_id 
         left join address a on s.address_id = a.address_id
         left join city c on a.city_id = c.city_id
         left join country c2 on c.country_id = c2.country_id
")
sp_print_df(store_employees_sql)
```

### 3. How Many Active, Inactive, and Total Customers Does the DVD Rental Business Have?

To answer this question we look at the `customer` table.  In a previous chapter we observed that there are two columns, `activebool` and `active`.  We consider `active = 1` as active.


```r
customer_cnt_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"SELECT sum(case when active = 1 then 1 else 0 end) active
       ,sum(case when active = 0 then 1 else 0 end) inactive
       ,count(*) total
   from customer
")

sp_print_df(customer_cnt_sql)
```

### 4. How Many and What Percent of Customers Are From Each Country?

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables. 


```r
customers_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select c.active,country.country,count(*) count
              ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct
         from customer c
              join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
              join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id
              join country on city.country_id = country.country_id

### 5 What Countries Constitute the Top 25% of the Customer Base?

Using the previous code, add two new columns.  One column shows a running total and the second column shows a running percentage.  Order the data by count then by country.

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables again.


```r
country_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
                            
"select active,country,count
       ,sum(count) over (order by count desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_total
       , pct
       ,sum(pct) over (order by pct desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_pct
  from (-- Start of inner SQL Block
        select c.active,country.country,count(*) count
              ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct
         from customer c
              join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
              join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id

### 8.  What is the distribution of DVD's by Language 

To answer this question we look at the `language` and `film` tables.


```r
language_distribution_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
'
select l.language_id,name "language",count(f.film_id)
  from language l left join film f on l.language_id = f.language_id
group by l.language_id,name
order by l.language_id
')

sp_print_df(language_distribution_sql)
```

### 9.  What are the number of rentals and rented amount by store, by month?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to answer this question.

### 11 What is the rental distribution/DVD for the top two rented films?

From the previous exercise we know that the top two films are `Bucket Brotherhood` and `Rocketeer Mother`.  

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables again.  

Instead of looking at the film level, we need to drill down to the individual dvd's for each film to answer this question.



```r
film_rank2_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id,count(*) 
   from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
        join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
  where i.film_id in (103,738)
group by i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id")

sp_print_df(film_rank2_sql)
```

### 12.  List staffing information for store 1 associated with the `Bucket Brother` rentals? 

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, `film`, `staff`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables.  


```r
film_103_details_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id inv_id,i.store_id inv_store_id

To answer this question we look at the `category` table again.


```r
film_categories2_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,

### 27.  Who are the top-n1 and bottom-n2 customers?

The issue with the two previous reports is that the top end is hardcoded, rentals  > 40.  Over time, the current customers will always be in the top section and new customers will get added.  Another way of looking at the previous report is to show just the top and bottom 5 customers.  

Parameterize the previous exercise to show the top 5 and bottom 5 customers. 

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `rental`, and `payments` tables again.


```r
customer_rentals_hi_low_sql <- function(high_n,low_n) {
    customer_rental_high_low_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
        "select *
           from (     select *
                            ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY rentals desc) rent_hi_low
                            ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY rentals ) rent_low_hi
                       FROM (    
                                 select c.customer_id id
                                       ,concat(c.first_name,' ',c.last_name) customer
                                       ,count(*) cust_cnt
                                       ,count(r.rental_id) rentals
                                       ,count(p.payment_id) payments
                                       ,sum(coalesce(p.amount,0)) paid_amt
                                  from customer c 
                                       left outer join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
                                       left outer join payment p on r.rental_id = p.rental_id
                                 group by c.customer_id
                                        ,c.first_name
                                        ,c.last_name
                            ) as summary
                ) row_nums
           where rent_hi_low <= $1 or rent_low_hi <= $2
          order by rent_hi_low
        "
           ,c(high_n,low_n)
        )
    return (customer_rental_high_low_sql)
}
```

The next code block executes a sql version of such a function.  With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 5, it replicates the hard coded version of the previous exercise. With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 0, it gives a top 5 report.  With top_n = 0 and bot_n = 5, the report returns the bottom 5.  Change the two parameters to see the output from the different combinations.


```r
top_n = 5
bot_n = 5
sp_print_df(customer_rentals_hi_low_sql(top_n,bot_n))
```

### 28.  How much has each store collected?

How are the stores performing?  The SQL code shows the payments made to each store in the business.


```r

### 29.  What is the business' distribution of payments?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `payment`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to answer this question.

As a sanity check, we first check the number of rentals and amount payments.



```r
rentals_payments_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select 'rentals' rec_type, count(*) cnt_amt from rental
 union
 select 'payments' rec_type, sum(amount) from payment ")

With over 40 percent over collection, someone needs to find out what is wrong with the collection process.  Many customers are owed credits or free rentals.

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

This table describes the columns in the code block answer that follows.  There are payment records where the charged amount, rental rate, is less than the amount paid.  These payments are split into two pieces, rate_lt_paid and rate_lt_over_paid.  The rate_lt_paid is rental rate amount.  The rate_lt_over_paid is the paid amount - rental rate, the over paid amount.

#### Bad data analysis

Here are the sanity check numbers calculated at the beginning of this exercise.  

  rec_type |cnt_amt
-----------|-------
payments   |61312.04
 rentals   |16045.00
 
Note that the sanity check numbers above, do not match the numbers above.  If you query returned the numbers above, use the following result set ot see where the differences exist.


```r
rs <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
 "SELECT  'correct join' hint,r.rental_id,r.customer_id,p.customer_id payment_customer_id,p.rental_id payment_rental_id,p.amount

### 30.  Which customers have the highest open amounts?

From the previous exercise, we know that there are 1477 missing payment records or not fully paid payment records.  List the top 5 customers from each category base on balance due amounts.

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `payment`, `inventory`, `film` and `customer` tables to answer this question.

### 31. What is the business cash flow?

In the previous exercise we saw that about 50% of the rentals collected the correct amount and 40% of the rentals over collected.  The last 10% were never collected.

Calculate the number of days it took before the payment was collected and the amount collected?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `customer`, `payment`, `inventory`, `payment` and `film` tables to answer this question.


```r

### 32.  Customer information

Create a function that takes a customer id and returns

*  customer address information
*  films rented and returned information
*  customer payment information

The hidden code block implements such a function in SQL.

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `customer`, `address`, `city, `country`, `inventory`, `payment` and `film` tables to answer this question.  


```r
customer_details_fn_sql <- function(cust_id) {
    customer_details_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
    "select c.customer_id id,concat(first_name,' ',c.last_name) customer
          ,c.email,a.phone,a.address,address2,city.city,a.postal_code,ctry.country

          ,case when r.return_date is null
                then null
                else r.return_date::date  - (r.rental_date + INTERVAL '1 day'  * f.rental_duration)::date
           end rtn_stat
          ,case when r.rental_id is null
                then null
                      -- dvd returned             
                when r.return_date is null

      from customer c left join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
                      left join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
                      left join city on city.city_id = a.city_id
                      left join country ctry on ctry.country_id = city.country_id
                      left join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
                      left join payment p on c.customer_id = p.customer_id and p.rental_id = r.rental_id
                      left join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
     where c.customer_id = $1
    order by id,rented desc
    "
    ,cust_id
    )
    return(customer_details_sql)
}
```

The following code block executes the customer function. Change the `cust_id` value to see differnt customers.


```r
cust_id <- 600
sp_print_df( customer_details_fn_sql(cust_id))
