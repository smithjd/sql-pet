Edward (Ed) Borasky, Scott Case, and Sophie Yang 2018-10-22 Chapter 1 Introduction At the end of this chapter, you will be able to Understand the importance of using R and Docker to query a DBMS and access a service like Postgres outside of R. Setup your environment to explore the use-case for useRs. 1.1 Using R to query a DBMS in your organization Large data stores in organizations are stored in databases that have specific access constraints and structural characteristics. Data documentation may be incomplete, often emphasizes operational issues rather than analytic ones, and often needs to be confirmed on the fly. Data volumes and query performance are important design constraints. R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures and coding schemes to address incompletely formed questions so that exploratory data analysis has to be fast. Exploratory techniques for the purpose should not be reinvented (and so would benefit from more public instruction or discussion). Learning to navigate the interfaces (passwords, packages, etc.) between R and a database is difficult to simulate outside corporate walls. Resources for interface problem diagnosis behind corporate walls may or may not address all the issues that R users face, so a simulated environment is needed. 1.2 Docker as a tool for UseRs Noam Ross’s “Docker for the UseR” suggests that there are four distinct Docker use-cases for useRs. Make a fixed working environment for reproducible analysis Access a service outside of R (e.g., Postgres) Create an R based service (e.g., with plumber) Send our compute jobs to the cloud with minimal reconfiguration or revision This book explores #2 because it allows us to work on the database access issues described above and to practice on an industrial-scale DBMS. Docker is a relatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/RStudio session and a database – all on on a single machine, provided you have Docker installed and running. You may want to run PostgreSQL on a Docker container, avoiding any OS or system dependencies that might come up. 1.3 Why write a book about DBMS access from R using Docker? Large data stores in organizations are stored in databases that have specific access constraints and structural characteristics. Learning to navigate the gap between R and the database is difficult to simulate outside corporate walls. R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures using diagnostic techniques that should not be reinvented (and so would benefit from more public instruction and commentary). Docker is a relatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/Rstudio session and database – all on on a single machine. 1.4 Docker and R on your machine Here is how R and Docker fit on your operating system in this tutorial: (This diagram needs to be updated as our directory structure evolves.) 1.5 Who are we?

The database we use is PostgreSQL 10, but you do not need to install that - it’s installed via a Docker image. RStudio 1.2 is highly recommended but not required. In addition to the current version of R and RStudio, you will need current versions of the following packages: tidyverse DBI RPostgres glue dbplyr knitr 2.2 Installing Docker Install Docker. Installation depends on your operating system: On a Mac On UNIX flavors For Windows, consider these issues and follow these instructions. 2.3 Download the repo The code to generate the book and the exercises it contains can be downloaded from this repo. 2.4 Read along, experiment as you go We have never been sure whether we’re writing an expository book or a massive tutorial. You may use it either way. After the introductory chapters and the chapter that creates the persistent database (&quot;The dvdrental database in Postgres in Docker (05)), you can jump around and each chapter stands on its own.

["docker-hosting-for-windows-02.html", "Chapter 3 Docker Hosting for Windows (02) 3.1 Hardware requirements 3.2 Software requirements 3.3 Docker for Windows settings 3.4 Git, GitHub and line endings", " Chapter 3 Docker Hosting for Windows (02) At the end of this chapter, you will be able to Setup your environment for Windows. Use Git and GitHub effectively on Windows. Skip these instructions if your computer has either OSX or a Unix variant. 3.1 Hardware requirements You will need an Intel or AMD processor with 64-bit hardware and the hardware virtualization feature. Most machines you buy today will have that, but older ones may not. You will need to go into the BIOS / firmware and enable the virtualization feature. You will need at least 4 gigabytes of RAM! 3.2 Software requirements You will need Windows 7 64-bit or later. If you can afford it, I highly recommend upgrading to Windows 10 Pro. 3.2.1 Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 Home (64 bit) Install Docker Toolbox. The instructions are here: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/. Make sure you try the test cases and they work! 3.2.2 Windows 10 Pro Install Docker for Windows stable. The instructions are here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#start-docker-for-windows. Again, make sure you try the test cases and they work. 3.3 Docker for Windows settings 3.3.1 Shared drives If you’re going to mount host files into container file systems (as we do in the following chapters), you need to set up shared drives. Open the Docker settings dialog and select Shared Drives. Check the drives you want to share. In this screenshot, the D: drive is my 1 terabyte hard drive. 3.3.2 Kubernetes Kubernetes is a container orchestration / cloud management package that’s a major DevOps tool. It’s heavily supported by Red Hat and Google, and as a result is becoming a required skill for DevOps. However, it’s overkill for this project at the moment. So you should make sure it’s not enabled. Go to the Kubernetes dialog and make sure the Enable Kubernetes checkbox is cleared. 3.4 Git, GitHub and line endings Git was originally developed for Linux - in fact, it was created by Linus Torvalds to manage hundreds of different versions of the Linux kernel on different machines all around the world. As usage has grown, Git has achieved a huge following and is the version control system used by most large open source projects, including this one. If you’re on Windows, there are some things about Git and GitHub you need to watch. First of all, there are quite a few tools for running Git on Windows, but the RStudio default and recommended one is Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win). By default, text files on Linux end with a single linefeed (\\n) character. But on Windows, text files end with a carriage return and a line feed (\\r\\n). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline for the gory details. Git defaults to checking files out in the native mode. So if you’re on Linux, a text file will show up with the Linux convention, and if you’re on Windows, it will show up with the Windows convention. Most of the time this doesn’t cause any problems. But Docker containers usually run Linux, and if you have files from a repository on Windows that you’ve sent to the container, the container may malfunction or give weird results. This kind of situation has caused a lot of grief for contributors to this project, so beware. In particular, executable sh or bash scripts will fail in a Docker container if they have Windows line endings. You may see an error message with \\r in it, which means the shell saw the carriage return (\\r) and gave up. But often you’ll see no hint at all what the problem was. So you need a way to tell Git that some files need to be checked out with Linux line endings. See https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/ for the details. Summary: You’ll need a .gitattributes file in the root of the repository. In that file, all text files (scripts, program source, data, etc.) that are destined for a Docker container will need to have the designator &lt;spec&gt; text eol=lf, where &lt;spec&gt; is the file name specifier, for example, *.sh. This repo includes a sample: .gitattributes "],

Run queries against PostgreSQL in an environment that simulates what you will find in a corporate setting. Understand techniques and some of the trade-offs between: queries aimed at exploration or informal investigation using dplyr; and those where performance is important because of the size of the database or the frequency with which a query is run. Understand the equivalence between dplyr and SQL queries and how R translates one into the other Understand some more advanced SQL techniques. Gain familiarity with the standard metadata that an SQL database contains to describe its own contents. Gain some understanding of techniques for assessing query structure and performance. Understand enough about Docker to swap databases, e.g. Sports DB for the DVD rental database used in this tutorial. Or swap the database management system (DBMS), e.g. MySQL for PostgreSQL. 4.2 Imaging a DVD rental business Years ago people rented videos on DVD disks and video stores were a big business. Imagine managing a video rental store like Movie Madness in Portland, Oregon. What data would be needed and what questions would you have to answer about the business? This tutorial uses the Postgres version of “dvd rental” database which represents the transaction database for running a movie (e.g., dvd) rental business. The database can be downloaded here. Here’s a glimpse of it’s structure, which will be discussed in some detail: Entity Relationship diagram for the dvdrental database A data analyst uses the database abstraction and the practical business questions to answer business questions. 4.3 Use cases Imagine that you have one of several roles at our fictional company DVDs R Us and that you need to: As a data scientist, I want to know the distribution of number of rentals per month per customer, so that the Marketing department can create incentives for customers in 3 segments: Frequent Renters, Average Renters, Infrequent Renters. As the Director of Sales, I want to see the total number of rentals per month for the past 6 months and I want to know how fast our customer base is growing/shrinking per month for the past 6 months. As the Director of Marketing, I want to know which categories of DVDs are the least popular, so that I can create a campaign to draw attention to rarely used inventory. As a shipping clerk, I want to add rental information when I fulfill a shipment order. As the Director of Analytics, I want to test as much of the production R code in my shop as possible against a new release of the DBMS that the IT department is implementing next month. etc. 4.4 Investigating a question using with an organization’s database Need both familiarity with the data and a focus question An iterative process where the data resource can shape your understanding of the question the question you need to answer will frame how your see the data resource You need to go back and forth between the two, asking do I understand the question? do I understand the data? How well do you understand the data resource (in the DBMS)? Use all available documentation and understand its limits Use your own tools and skills to examine the data resource what’s missing from the database: (columns, records, cells) why is there missing data? How well do you understand the question you seek to answer? How general or specific is your question? How aligned is it with the purpose for which the database was designed and is being operated? How different are your assumptions and concerns from those of the people who enter and use the data on a day to day basis? "],

See how to keep credentials secret in code that’s visible to the world. Interact with Postgres using Rstudio inside Docker container. # Read and write to postgreSQL from R.

Devtools install of sqlpetr if not already installed 5.1 Verify that Docker is running Docker commands can be run from a terminal (e.g., the Rstudio Terminal pane) or with a system() command. In this tutorial, we use system2() so that all the output that is created externally is shown. Note that system2 calls are divided into several parts: The program that you are sending a command to. The parameters or commands that are being sent. stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE are two parameters that are standard in this book, so that the command’s full output is shown in the book. Check that docker is up and running: sp_check_that_docker_is_up() ## [1] &quot;Docker is up but running no containers&quot; 5.2 Clean up if appropriate Remove the cattle and sql-pet containers if they exists (e.g., from a prior experiments). sp_docker_remove_container(&quot;cattle&quot;) ## Warning in system2(&quot;docker&quot;, docker_command, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE): ## running command &#39;&#39;docker&#39; rm -f cattle 2&gt;&amp;1&#39; had status 1 ## [1] &quot;Error: No such container: cattle&quot; ## attr(,&quot;status&quot;) ## [1] 1 sp_docker_remove_container(&quot;sql-pet&quot;) ## [1] &quot;sql-pet&quot; The convention we use in this book is to put docker commands in the sqlpetr package so that you can ignore them if you want. However, the functions are set up so that you can easily see how to do things with Docker and modify if you want. We name containers cattle for “throw-aways” and pet for ones we treasure and keep around. :-) sp_make_simple_pg(&quot;cattle&quot;) ## [1] 0 Docker returns a long string of numbers. If you are running this command for the first time, Docker downloads the PostgreSQL image, which takes a bit of time. The following command shows that a container named cattle is running postgres:10. postgres is waiting for a connection: sp_check_that_docker_is_up() ## [1] &quot;Docker is up, running these containers:&quot; ## [2] &quot;CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES&quot; ## [3] &quot;8e6523ae3212 postgres:10 \\&quot;docker-entrypoint.s…\\&quot; 1 second ago Up Less than a second 0.0.0.0:5432-&gt;5432/tcp cattle&quot; 5.3 Connect, read and write to Postgres from R 5.3.1 Pause for some security considerations We use the following sp_get_postgres_connection function, which will repeatedly try to connect to PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL can take different amounts of time to come up and be ready to accept connections from R, depending on various factors that will be discussed later on. When we call sp_get_postgres_connection we'll use environment variables that R obtains from reading a file named .Renviron. That file is not uploaded to Github and R looks for it in your default directory. To see whether you have already created that file, execute this in your R session: dir(path = \"~\", pattern = \".Renviron\", all.files = TRUE) That file should contain lines such as: DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME=postgres Those are the PostreSQL default values for the username and password, so not secret. But this approach demonstrates how they would be kept secret and not uploaded to Github or some other public location when you need to keep credentials secret. This is how the sp_get_postgres_connection function is used: con &lt;- sp_get_postgres_connection(user = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME&quot;), password = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD&quot;), dbname = &quot;postgres&quot;, seconds_to_test = 10) If you don’t have an .Rprofile file that defines those passwords, you can just insert a string for the parameter, like: password = 'whatever', Make sure that you can connect to the PostgreSQL database that you started earlier. If you have been executing the code from this tutorial, the database will not contain any tables yet: dbListTables(con) ## character(0) 5.3.2 Alternative: put the database password in an environment file The goal is to put the password in an untracked file that will not be committed in your source code repository. Your code can reference the name of the variable, but the value of that variable will not appear in open text in your source code. We have chosen to call the file dev_environment.csv in the current working directory where you are executing this script. That file name appears in the .gitignore file, so that you will not accidentally commit it. We are going to create that file now. You will be prompted for the database password. By default, a PostgreSQL database defines a database user named postgres, whose password is postgres. If you have changed the password or created a new user with a different password, then enter those new values when prompted. Otherwise, enter postgres and postgres at the two prompts. In an interactive environment, you could execute a snippet of code that prompts the user for their username and password with the following snippet (which isn’t run in the book): Your password is still in plain text in the file, dev_environment.csv, so you should protect that file from exposure. However, you do not need to worry about committing that file accidentally to your git repository, because the name of the file appears in the .gitignore file. For security, we use values from the environment_variables data.frame, rather than keeping the username and password in plain text in a source file. 5.3.3 Interact with Postgres Write mtcars to PostgreSQL dbWriteTable(con, &quot;mtcars&quot;, mtcars, overwrite = TRUE) List the tables in the PostgreSQL database to show that mtcars is now there: dbListTables(con) ## [1] &quot;mtcars&quot; # list the fields in mtcars: dbListFields(con, &quot;mtcars&quot;) ## [1] &quot;mpg&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; &quot;wt&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;gear&quot; ## [11] &quot;carb&quot; Download the table from the DBMS to a local data frame: mtcars_df &lt;- tbl(con, &quot;mtcars&quot;) # Show a few rows: knitr::kable(head(mtcars_df)) mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 5.4 Clean up Afterwards, always disconnect from the DBMS, stop the docker container and (optionally) remove it. dbDisconnect(con) # tell Docker to stop the container: sp_docker_stop(&quot;cattle&quot;) ## [1] &quot;cattle&quot; # Tell Docker to remove the container from it&#39;s library of active containers: sp_docker_remove_container(&quot;cattle&quot;) ## [1] &quot;cattle&quot; If we stop the docker container but don’t remove it (with the rm cattle command), the container will persist and we can start it up again later with start cattle. In that case, mtcars would still be there and we could retrieve it from R again. Since we have now removed the cattle container, the whole database has been deleted. (There are enough copies of mtcars in the world, so no great loss.) "],

The first time it runs it will take a minute to create the PostgreSQL environment. There are two important parts to this that may not be obvious: The source= parameter points to dvdrental.Dockerfile, which does most of the heavy lifting. It has detailed, line-by-line comments to explain what it is doing. Inside dvdrental.Dockerfile the command COPY init-dvdrental.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ copies init-dvdrental.sh from the local file system into the specified location in the Docker container. When the PostgreSQL Docker container initializes, it looks for that file and executes it. Doing all of that work behind the scenes involves two layers of complexity.

Coverage in this book. There are many SQL tutorials that are available. For example, we are drawing some materials from a tutorial we recommend. In particular, we will not replicate the lessons there, which you might want to complete. Instead, we are showing strategies that are recommended for R users. That will include some translations of queries that are discussed there. 7.2 Ask yourself, what are you aiming for? Differences between production and data warehouse environments. Learning to keep your DBAs happy: You are your own DBA in this simulation, so you can wreak havoc and learn from it, but you can learn to be DBA-friendly here. In the end it’s the subject-matter experts that understand your data, but you have to work with your DBAs first. 7.3 Get some basic information about your database Assume that the Docker container with PostgreSQL and the dvdrental database are ready to go. Start up the docker-pet container sp_docker_start(&quot;sql-pet&quot;) Now connect to the dvdrental database with R con &lt;- sp_get_postgres_connection( user = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME&quot;), password = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD&quot;), dbname = &quot;dvdrental&quot;, seconds_to_test = 10) con ## &lt;PqConnection&gt; dvdrental@localhost:5432 The following code block confirms that one can connect to the Postgres database. The connection is needed for some of the examples/exercises used in this section. If the connection is successful, the output is &lt;PostgreSQLConnection&gt;. 7.4 Tutorial Environment Below is a high level diagram of our tutorial environment. The single black or blue boxed items are the apps running on your PC, (Linux, Mac, Windows), RStudio, R, Docker, and CLI, a command line interface. The red boxed items are the versions of the applications shown. The labels are to the right of the line. 7.5 Communicating with Docker Applications One assumption we made is that most users use RStudio to interface with R. The four take aways from the diagram above are labeled: dbConnect R-SQL processing, the purpose of this tutorial, is performed via a database connection. This should be a simple task, but often turns out to take a lot of time to actually get it to work. We assume that your final write ups are done in some flavor of an Rmd document and others will have access to the database to confirm or further your analysis. For this tutorial, the following are the hardcoded values used to make the Postgres database connection. con &lt;- sp_get_postgres_connection( user = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME&quot;), password = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD&quot;), dbname = &quot;dvdrental&quot;, seconds_to_test = 10) The main focus of the entire tutorial is SQL processing through a dbConnection. The remainder of this section focuses on some specific Docker commands. bash The Docker container runs on top of a small Linux kernel foot print. Since Mac and Linux users run a version of Linux already, they may want to poke around the Docker environment. Below is the CLI command to start up a bash session, execute a version of hello world, and exit the bash session. c:\\Git\\sql-pet&gt;docker exec -ti sql-pet bash root@7e43294b72cf:/# echo &quot;&#39;hello world&#39;&quot; talking to you live from a bash shell session within Docker! &#39;hello world&#39; talking to you live from a bash shell session within Docker! root@7e43294b72cf:/# exit exit Note that the user in the example is root. Root has all priviledges and can destroy the Docker environment. psql For users comfortable executing SQL from a command line directly against the database, one can run the psql application directly. Below is the CLI command to start up psql session, execute a version of hello world, and quitting the psql version. c:\\Git\\sql-pet&gt;docker exec -ti sql-pet psql -a -p 5432 -d dvdrental -U postgres psql (10.5 (Debian 10.5-1.pgdg90+1)) Type &quot;help&quot; for help. dvdrental=# select &#39;&quot;hello world&quot; talking to you live from postgres session within Docker!&#39; hello; hello ------------------------------------------------------------------------ &quot;hello world&quot; talking to you live from postgres session within Docker! (1 row) dvdrental=# \\q All SQL commands need to end with a semi-colon. To exit psql, use a \\q at the command prompt. The docker bash and psql command options are optional for this tutorial, but open up a gateway to some very powerful programming techniques for future exploration. start-stop Docker has about 44 commands. We are interested in only those related to Postgres status, started, stopped, and available. In this tutorial, complete docker commands are printed out before being executed via a system2 call. In the event that a code block fails, one can copy and paste the docker command into your local CLI and see if Docker is returning additional information. 7.6 Exercises Docker containers have a small foot print. In our container, we are running a limited Linux kernel and a Postgres database. To show how tiny the docker environment is, we will look at all the processes running inside Docker and the top level file structure. 7.6.1 Docker Help Typing docker at the command line will print up a summary of all available docker commands. Below are the docker commands used in the exercises. Commands: ps List containers start Start one or more stopped containers stop Stop one or more running containers The general format for a Docker command is docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND ARGUMENTS Below is the output for the Docker exec help command which was used in the bash and psql command examples above and for an exercise below.

We begin with simple extraction, or “downloading” data. 8.1.1 Finding out what’s there We’ve already seen the simplest way of getting a list of tables in a database with DBI functions that list tables and fields. Here are the (public) tables in the database: DBI::dbListTables(con) ## [1] &quot;actor_info&quot; &quot;customer_list&quot; ## [3] &quot;film_list&quot; &quot;nicer_but_slower_film_list&quot; ## [5] &quot;sales_by_film_category&quot; &quot;staff&quot; ## [7] &quot;sales_by_store&quot; &quot;staff_list&quot; ## [9] &quot;category&quot; &quot;film_category&quot; ## [11] &quot;country&quot; &quot;actor&quot; ## [13] &quot;language&quot; &quot;inventory&quot; ## [15] &quot;payment&quot; &quot;rental&quot; ## [17] &quot;city&quot; &quot;store&quot; ## [19] &quot;film&quot; &quot;address&quot; ## [21] &quot;film_actor&quot; &quot;customer&quot; Here are the fields (or columns or variables) in one specific table: DBI::dbListFields(con, &quot;rental&quot;) ## [1] &quot;rental_id&quot; &quot;rental_date&quot; &quot;inventory_id&quot; &quot;customer_id&quot; ## [5] &quot;return_date&quot; &quot;staff_id&quot; &quot;last_update&quot; Later on we’ll discuss how to get more extensive data about each table and column from the database’s own store of metadata. 8.1.2 Downloading an entire table There are many different methods of getting data from a DBMS, and we’ll explore the different ways of controlling each one of them. DBI::dbReadTable will download an entire table into an R tibble. rental_tibble &lt;- DBI::dbReadTable(con, &quot;rental&quot;) str(rental_tibble) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 16044 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ rental_id : int 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ... ## $ rental_date : POSIXct, format: &quot;2005-05-24 22:54:33&quot; &quot;2005-05-24 23:03:39&quot; ... ## $ inventory_id: int 1525 1711 2452 2079 2792 3995 2346 2580 1824 4443 ... ## $ customer_id : int 459 408 333 222 549 269 239 126 399 142 ... ## $ return_date : POSIXct, format: &quot;2005-05-28 19:40:33&quot; &quot;2005-06-01 22:12:39&quot; ... ## $ staff_id : int 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ last_update : POSIXct, format: &quot;2006-02-16 02:30:53&quot; &quot;2006-02-16 02:30:53&quot; ... That’s very simple, but if the table is large it may not be a good idea. 8.1.3 Referencing a table for many different purposes The dplyr::tbl function gives us more control over access to a table. It returns a connection object that dplyr uses for constructing queries and retrieving data from the DBMS. rental_table &lt;- dplyr::tbl(con, &quot;rental&quot;) Consider the structure of the connection object: str(rental_table) ## List of 2 ## $ src:List of 2 ## ..$ con :Formal class &#39;PqConnection&#39; [package &quot;RPostgres&quot;] with 3 slots ## .. .. ..@ ptr :&lt;externalptr&gt; ## .. .. ..@ bigint : chr &quot;integer64&quot; ## .. .. ..@ typnames:&#39;data.frame&#39;: 437 obs. of 2 variables: ## .. .. .. ..$ oid : int [1:437] 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 ... ## .. .. .. ..$ typname: chr [1:437] &quot;bool&quot; &quot;bytea&quot; &quot;char&quot; &quot;name&quot; ... ## ..$ disco: NULL ## ..- attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;src_dbi&quot; &quot;src_sql&quot; &quot;src&quot; ## $ ops:List of 2 ## ..$ x : &#39;ident&#39; chr &quot;rental&quot; ## ..$ vars: chr [1:7] &quot;rental_id&quot; &quot;rental_date&quot; &quot;inventory_id&quot; &quot;customer_id&quot; ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;op_base_remote&quot; &quot;op_base&quot; &quot;op&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr [1:4] &quot;tbl_dbi&quot; &quot;tbl_sql&quot; &quot;tbl_lazy&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; It contains a list of variables in the table, among other things: rental_table$ops$vars ## [1] &quot;rental_id&quot; &quot;rental_date&quot; &quot;inventory_id&quot; &quot;customer_id&quot; ## [5] &quot;return_date&quot; &quot;staff_id&quot; &quot;last_update&quot; But because of lazy loading, R has not retrieved any actual data from the DBMS. We can trigger data extraction in several ways. Although printing rental_table just prints the connection object, head triggers a query and prints its results: rental_table %&gt;% head ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 7] ## # Database: postgres [postgres@localhost:5432/dvdrental] ## rental_id rental_date inventory_id customer_id ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2 2005-05-24 22:54:33 1525 459 ## 2 3 2005-05-24 23:03:39 1711 408 ## 3 4 2005-05-24 23:04:41 2452 333 ## 4 5 2005-05-24 23:05:21 2079 222 ## 5 6 2005-05-24 23:08:07 2792 549 ## 6 7 2005-05-24 23:11:53 3995 269 ## # ... with 3 more variables: return_date &lt;dttm&gt;, staff_id &lt;int&gt;, ## # last_update &lt;dttm&gt; 8.1.4 Sub-setting variables rental_table %&gt;% select(rental_date, return_date) %&gt;% head ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 2] ## # Database: postgres [postgres@localhost:5432/dvdrental] ## rental_date return_date ## &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; ## 1 2005-05-24 22:54:33 2005-05-28 19:40:33 ## 2 2005-05-24 23:03:39 2005-06-01 22:12:39 ## 3 2005-05-24 23:04:41 2005-06-03 01:43:41 ## 4 2005-05-24 23:05:21 2005-06-02 04:33:21 ## 5 2005-05-24 23:08:07 2005-05-27 01:32:07 ## 6 2005-05-24 23:11:53 2005-05-29 20:34:53 We won’t discuss dplyr methods for sub-setting variables, deriving new ones, or sub-setting rows based on the values found in the table because they are covered well in other places, including: Comprehensive reference: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/ Good tutorial: https://suzan.rbind.io/tags/dplyr/ 8.1.5 Controlling number of rows returned The collect function triggers the creation of a tibble and controls the number of rows that the DBMS sends to R. rental_table %&gt;% collect(n = 3) %&gt;% head ## # A tibble: 3 x 7 ## rental_id rental_date inventory_id customer_id ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2 2005-05-24 22:54:33 1525 459 ## 2 3 2005-05-24 23:03:39 1711 408 ## 3 4 2005-05-24 23:04:41 2452 333 ## # ... with 3 more variables: return_date &lt;dttm&gt;, staff_id &lt;int&gt;, ## # last_update &lt;dttm&gt; In this case the collect function triggers the execution of a query that counts the number of records in the table by staff_id: rental_table %&gt;% count(staff_id) %&gt;% collect() ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## staff_id n ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;S3: integer64&gt; ## 1 2 8004 ## 2 1 8040 The collect function affects how much is downloaded, not how many rows the DBMS needs to process the query. This query processes all of the rows in the table but only displays one row of output. rental_table %&gt;% count(staff_id) %&gt;% collect(n = 1) ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## staff_id n ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;S3: integer64&gt; ## 1 2 8004 8.1.6 Examining dplyr’s SQL query and re-using SQL code The show_query function shows how dplyr is translating your query: rental_table %&gt;% count(staff_id) %&gt;% show_query() ## &lt;SQL&gt; ## SELECT &quot;staff_id&quot;, COUNT(*) AS &quot;n&quot; ## FROM &quot;rental&quot; ## GROUP BY &quot;staff_id&quot; Here is an extensive discussion of how dplyr code is translated into SQL: https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/sql-translation.html The SQL code can be submitted directly to the DBMS with the DBI::dbGetQuery function: query_result &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, &#39;SELECT &quot;staff_id&quot;, COUNT(*) AS &quot;n&quot; FROM &quot;rental&quot; GROUP BY &quot;staff_id&quot;; &#39;) query_result ## staff_id n ## 1 2 8004 ## 2 1 8040 When you create a report to run repeated, you might want to put that query into R markdown. That way you can also execute that SQL code in a chunk with the following header: {sql, connection=con, output.var = &quot;mydataframe&quot;} SELECT &quot;staff_id&quot;, COUNT(*) AS &quot;n&quot; FROM &quot;rental&quot; GROUP BY &quot;staff_id&quot;; Rmarkdown will store the query result in a tibble: mydataframe ## staff_id n ## 1 2 8004 ## 2 1 8040 8.2 Investigating a single table Dealing with a large, complex database highlights the utility of specific tools in R. We include brief examples that we find to be handy: Base R structure: str printing out some of the data: datatable / kable / View summary statistics: summary glimpse skimr 8.2.1 str - a base package workhorse str is a workhorse function that lists variables, their type and a sample of the first few variable values. str(rental_tibble) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 16044 obs. of 7 variables: ## $ rental_id : int 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ... ## $ rental_date : POSIXct, format: &quot;2005-05-24 22:54:33&quot; &quot;2005-05-24 23:03:39&quot; ... ## $ inventory_id: int 1525 1711 2452 2079 2792 3995 2346 2580 1824 4443 ... ## $ customer_id : int 459 408 333 222 549 269 239 126 399 142 ... ## $ return_date : POSIXct, format: &quot;2005-05-28 19:40:33&quot; &quot;2005-06-01 22:12:39&quot; ... ## $ staff_id : int 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ last_update : POSIXct, format: &quot;2006-02-16 02:30:53&quot; &quot;2006-02-16 02:30:53&quot; ... 8.2.2 Always just look at your data with head, View or datadtable There is no substitute for looking at your data and R provides several ways to just browse it. The head and tail functions help control the number of rows that are displayed. In every-day practice you would look at more than just 6 rows, but hear we wrap head around the data frame: sp_print_df(head(rental_tibble)) 8.2.3 The summary function in base The basic statistics that the base package summary provides can serve a unique diagnostic purpose in this context. For example, the following output shows that rental_id is a sequential number from 1 to 16,049 with no gaps. The same is true of inventory_id. The number of NA’s is a good first guess as to the number of dvd’s rented out or lost on 2005-09-02 02:35:22. summary(rental_tibble) ## rental_id rental_date inventory_id ## Min. : 1 Min. :2005-05-24 22:53:30 Min. : 1 ## 1st Qu.: 4014 1st Qu.:2005-07-07 00:58:40 1st Qu.:1154 ## Median : 8026 Median :2005-07-28 16:04:32 Median :2291 ## Mean : 8025 Mean :2005-07-23 08:13:34 Mean :2292 ## 3rd Qu.:12037 3rd Qu.:2005-08-17 21:16:23 3rd Qu.:3433 ## Max. :16049 Max. :2006-02-14 15:16:03 Max. :4581 ## ## customer_id return_date staff_id ## Min. : 1.0 Min. :2005-05-25 23:55:21 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.:148.0 1st Qu.:2005-07-10 15:49:36 1st Qu.:1.000 ## Median :296.0 Median :2005-08-01 19:45:29 Median :1.000 ## Mean :297.1 Mean :2005-07-25 23:58:03 Mean :1.499 ## 3rd Qu.:446.0 3rd Qu.:2005-08-20 23:35:55 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :599.0 Max. :2005-09-02 02:35:22 Max. :2.000 ## NA&#39;s :183 ## last_update ## Min. :2006-02-15 21:30:53 ## 1st Qu.:2006-02-16 02:30:53 ## Median :2006-02-16 02:30:53 ## Mean :2006-02-16 02:31:31 ## 3rd Qu.:2006-02-16 02:30:53 ## Max. :2006-02-23 09:12:08 ## Here are some packages that we find handy in the preliminary investigation of a database (or a problem that involves data from a database). 8.2.4 The glimpse function in the tibble package The tibble package’s glimpse function is a more compact version of str: glimpse(rental_tibble) ## Observations: 16,044 ## Variables: 7 ## $ rental_id &lt;int&gt; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1... ## $ rental_date &lt;dttm&gt; 2005-05-24 22:54:33, 2005-05-24 23:03:39, 2005-0... ## $ inventory_id &lt;int&gt; 1525, 1711, 2452, 2079, 2792, 3995, 2346, 2580, 1... ## $ customer_id &lt;int&gt; 459, 408, 333, 222, 549, 269, 239, 126, 399, 142,... ## $ return_date &lt;dttm&gt; 2005-05-28 19:40:33, 2005-06-01 22:12:39, 2005-0... ## $ staff_id &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2... ## $ last_update &lt;dttm&gt; 2006-02-16 02:30:53, 2006-02-16 02:30:53, 2006-0... 8.2.5 The skim function in the skmir package The skimr package has several functions that make it easy to examine an unknown data frame and assess what it contains.

SQL Category Definition DDL:Data Definition Language DBA’s execute these commands to define objects in the database. DML:Data Manipulation Language Users and developers execute these commands to investigate data. DCL:Data Control Language DBA’s execute these commands to grant/revoke access to TCL:Transaction Control Language Developers execute these commands when developing applications. Data analysts use the SELECT DML command to learn interesting things about the data stored in the database. Applications are used to control the insert, update, and deletion of data in the database. Data users can update the database objects via the application which enforces referential integrity in the database, but not directly against the application database objects. DBA’s can setup a sandbox within the database for a data analyst. The application(s) do not maintain the data in the sandbox. In addition to the SELECT command, data analysts may be granted any or all the commands in the DDL and DML sections in the table below. The most common ones are the DML commands with a star, &quot;*. &quot; DDL DML DCL TCL ALTER CALL GRANT COMMIT CREATE DELETE* REVOKE ROLLBACK DROP EXPLAIN PLAN SAVEPOINT RENAME INSERT* SET TRANSACTION TRUNCATE LOCK TABLE MERGE SELECT* UPDATE* Most relational database applications are designed for speed, speedy on-line transactional processing, OLTP, and a lot of parent child relationships. Such applications can have 100’s or even 1000’s of tables supporting the application. The goal is to transform the application data model into a useful data analysis model using the DDL and DML SQL statements. The sql-pet database is tiny, but for the purposes of these exercises, we assume that data so large that it will not easily fit into the memory of your laptop. A SQL SELECT statement consists of 1 to 6 clauses. In the table below, object refers to either a database table or a view object. SQL Clause DPLYR Verb SQL Description SELECT SELECT() Contains a list of column names from an object or a derived value. mutate() FROM Contains a list of related objects from which the SELECT list of columns is derived. WHERE filter() Provides the filter conditions the objects in the FROM clause must meet. GROUP BY group_by() Contains a list unique column values returned from the WHERE clause. HAVING Provides the filter condition on the the GROUP BY clause. ORDER BY arrange() Contains a list of column names indicating the order of the column value. Each column can be either ASCending or DEScending. 10.2 Query statement structure A SQL query statement consists of six distinct parts and each part is referred to as a clause. The foundation of the SQL language is based set theory and the result of a SQL query is referred to as a result set. A SQL query statement is “guaranteed” to return the same set of data, but not necessarily in the same order. However, in practice, the result set is usually in the same order. For this tutorial, a SQL query either returns a detailed row set or a summarized row set. The detailed row set can show, but is not required to show every column. A summarized row set requires one or more summary columns and the associated aggregated summary values. Sales reps may be interested a detailed sales report showing all their activity. At the end of the month, the sales rep may be interested at a summary level based on product line dollars. The sales manager may be more interest in territory dollars. 10.3 SQL Clauses Select Clause From Clause Where Clause Group By Clause Having Clause Order By Clause This section focuses on getting new SQL users familiar with the six SQL query clauses and a single table. SQL queries from multiple tables are discussed in the JOIN section of this tutorial. For lack of a better term, a SQL-QBE, a very simple SQL Query by example, is used to illustrate some SQL feature. Side Note: This version of Postgres requires all SQL statments be terminated with a semi-colon. Some older flavors of SQL and GUI tools do not require the SQL statement to be terminated with a semi-colon, ‘;’ for the command to be executed. It is recommended that you always terminate your SQL commands with a semi-colon. 10.4 SELECT Clause: Column Selection – Vertical Partioning of Data 10.4.1 1. Simplest SQL query: All rows and all columns from a single table. dvdrental=# select * from store; store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update 1 1 1 2006-02-15 09:57:12 2 2 2 2006-02-15 09:57:12 10.4.2 2. Same Query as 1, but only show first two columns; dvdrental=# select STORE_ID, manager_staff_id from store; store_id manager_staff_id 1 1 2 2 10.4.3 3. Same Query as 2, but reverse the column order dvdrental=# select manager_staff_id,store_id from store; manager_staff_id store_id 1 1 2 2 10.4.4 4. Rename Columns – SQL column alias in the result set dvdrental=# select manager_staff_id mgr_sid,store_id &quot;store id&quot; from store; mgr_sid store id 1 1 2 2 The manager_staff_id has changed to mgr_sid. store_id has changed to store id. In practice, aliasing column names that have a space is not done. Note that the column names have changed in the result set only, not in the actual database table. The DBA&#39;s will not allow a space or other special characters in a database table column name. Some motivations for aliasing the result set column names are 1. Some database table column names are not user friendly. 2. When multiple tables are joined, the column names may be the same in one or more tables and one needs to distinguish between the column names from the different tables. 10.4.5 5. Adding labels and Additional Columns to the Result Set dvdrental=# select &#39;derived column&#39; showing ,* ,current_database() db ,user ,to_char(now(),&#39;YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS&#39;) dtts from store; showing store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update db user dtts derived column 1 1 1 2006-02-15 09:57:12 dvdrental postgres 2018/10/07 20:20:28 derived column 2 2 2 2006-02-15 09:57:12 dvdrental postgres 2018/10/07 20:20:28 All the previous examples easily fit on a single line. This one is longer. Each column is entered on its own line, indented past the select keyword, and preceeded by a comma. 1. The showing column is a hard coded string surrounded by single quotes. Note that single quotes are for hard coded values and double quotes are for column aliases. 2. The db and dtts, date timestamp, are new columns generated from Postgres System Information Functions. 3. Note that `user` is not a function call, no parenthesis. 10.5 SQL Comments https://pgexercises.com/questions/basic SQL supports both a single line comment, preceed the line with two dashes, --, and a C like block comment, \\* … */. 10.5.1 6. Single line comment – dvdrental=# select &#39;single line comment, dtts&#39; showing ,* ,current_database() db ,user -- ,to_char(now(),&#39;YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS&#39;) dtts from store; showing store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update db user single line comment, dtts 1 1 1 2006-02-15 09:57:12 dvdrental postgres single line comment, dtts 2 2 2 2006-02-15 09:57:12 dvdrental postgres The dtts line is commented out with the two dashes and is dropped from the end of the result set columns. 10.5.2 7. Multi-line comment /*…*/ dvdrental=# select &#39;block comment drop db, user, and dtts&#39; showing ,* /* ,current_database() db ,user ,to_char(now(),&#39;YYYY/MM/DD HH24:MI:SS&#39;) dtts */ from store; showing store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update block comment drop db, user, and dtts 1 1 1 2006-02-15 09:57:12 block comment drop db, user, and dtts 2 2 2 2006-02-15 09:57:12 The three columns db, user, and dtts, between the /\\* and \\*/ have been commented and no longer appear as the end columns of the result set. 10.6 FROM Clause The FROM clause contains database tables/views from which the SELECT columns are derived. For now, in the examples, we are only using a single table. If the database reflects a relational model, your data is likely spread out over several tables. The key take away when beginning your analysis is to pick the table that has most of the data that you need for your analysis. This table becomes your main or driving table to build your SQL query statement around. After identifying your driving table, potentially save yourself a lot of time and heart ache. Review any view that is built on your driving table. If one or more exist, especially if vendor built, may already have the additional information need for your analysis. Insert SQL here or link to Views dependent on what In this tutorial, there is only a single user hitting the database and row/table locking is not necessary and considered out of scope. 10.6.1 Table Uses A table can be used more than once in a FROM clause. These are self-referencing table. An example is an EMPLOYEE table which contains a foriegn key to her manager. Her manager also has a foriegn key to her manager, etc up the corporate ladder. In the example above, the EMPLOYEE table plays two roles, employee and manager. The next line shows the FROM clause showing both rows. FROM EMPLOYEE EE, EMPLOYEE MGR The EE and MGR are role abbreviations for the EMPLOYEE table. Since all the column names are exactly the same for the EE and MGR role, the column names need to be prefixed with their role alias, e.g., SELECT MGR.EE_NAME, EE.EE_NAME … shows the manager name and her employee name who work for her. It is a good habit to always alias your tables and prefix your column names with the table alias to eliminate any ambiguity as to where the column came from. This is critical where there is inconsistent table column naming convention. Cover inline tables in future section Side Note: Do not create an unintended Cartesian join. If one has more than one table in the FROM clause, make sure that every table in the FROM clause joins to at least one other table. If your result set has an unexpectantly high rowcount and long runtime, check for a missing join in the FROM clause. 10.7 WHERE Clause: Row Selection – Horizontal Partitioning of Data In the previous SELECT clause section, the SELECT statement either partitioned data vertically across the table columns or derived vertical column values. This section provides examples that partitions the table data across rows in the table. The WHERE clause defines all the conditions the data must meet to be included or excluded in the final result set. If all the conditions are met data is returned or it is rejected. This is commonly referred to as the data set filter condition. Side Note: For performance optimization reasons, the WHERE clause should reduce the dataset down to the smallest dataset as quickly as possible. This is typically done using indexed columns, range conditions, and any other condition that rejects a lot of rows from being retrieved. The WHERE condition(s) can be simple or complex, but in the end are the appliction of the logic rules shown in the table below. p q p and q p or q T T T T T F F T T N N T F F F F F N F T N N N N When the filter logic is complex, it is sometimes easier to represent the where clause symbollically and apply a version of DeMorgan’s law which is shown below. (A and B)’ = A’ or B’ (A or B)’ = A’ and B’ 10.7.1 Example Continued We begin with 1, our simplest SQL query. dvdrental=# select * from store; store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update 1 1 1 2006-02-15 09:57:12 2 2 2 2006-02-15 09:57:12 10.7.2 7 WHERE condition logically never TRUE. dvdrental=# select * from store where 1 = 0; store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update Since 1 = 0 is always false, no rows are ever returned. Initially this construct seems useless, but actually is quite handy when debugging large scripts where a portion of the script needs to be turned off or when creating an empty table with the exact same column names and types as the FROM table(s). 10.7.3 8 WHERE condition logically always TRUE. dvdrental=# select * from store where 1 = 1; store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update 1 1 1 2006-02-15 09:57:12 2 2 2 2006-02-15 09:57:12 Since 1 = 1 is always true, all rows are always returned. Initially this construct seems useless, but actually is also quite handy when debugging large scripts and creating a backup of table. 10.7.4 9 WHERE equality condition dvdrental=# select * from store where store_id = 2; store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update 2 2 2 2006-02-15 09:57:12 The only row where the store_id = 2 is row 2. Only row 2 is kept and all others are dropped. 10.7.5 10 WHERE NOT equal conditions dvdrental=# select * from store where store_id &lt;&gt; 2; # &lt;&gt; syntactically the same as != store_id manager_staff_id address_id last_update 1 1 1 2006-02-15 09:57:12 The only row where the store_id &lt;&gt; 2 is row 1. Only row 1 is kept and all others are dropped. 10.7.6 10 WHERE OR condition dvdrental=# select * from store where manager_staff_id = 1 or store_id &lt;&gt; 2 or address_id = 3; Following table is modified from http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-operators SQL Comparison Operators Operator Description example = Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. (a = b) is not true. != Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. (a != b) is true. &lt;&gt; Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. (a &lt;&gt; b) is true. &gt; Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. (a &gt; b) is not true. &lt; Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. (a &lt; b) is true. &gt;= Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. (a &gt;= b) is not true. &lt;= Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. (a &lt;= b) is true. !&lt; Checks if the value of left operand is not less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. (a !&lt; b) is false. !&gt; Checks if the value of left operand is not greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. (a !&gt; b) is true. Operator Description ALL The ALL operator is used to compare a value to all values in another value set. AND The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement’s WHERE clause. ANY The ANY operator is used to compare a value to any applicable value in the list as per the condition. BETWEEN The BETWEEN operator is used to search for values that are within a set of values, given the minimum value and the maximum value. EXISTS The EXISTS operator is used to search for the presence of a row in a specified table that meets a certain criterion. IN The IN operator is used to compare a value to a list of literal values that have been specified. LIKE The LIKE operator is used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operators. NOT The NOT operator reverses the meaning of the logical operator with which it is used. Eg: NOT EXISTS, NOT BETWEEN, NOT IN, etc. This is a negate operator. OR The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement’s WHERE clause. IS NULL The NULL operator is used to compare a value with a NULL value. UNIQUE The UNIQUE operator searches every row of a specified table for uniqueness (no duplicates). 10.8 TO-DO’s inline tables correlated subqueries Binding order 3.1 FROM 3.2 ON 3.3 JOIN 3.4 WHERE 3.5 GROUP BY 3.6 WITH CUBE/ROLLUP 3.7 HAVING 3.8 SELECT 3.9 DISTINCT 3.10 ORDER BY 3.11 TOP 3.12 OFFSET/FETCH dplyr comparison of select features dplyr comparison of fetch versus where.

For example it’s worth learning to interpret the symbols in an Entity Relationship Diagram: The information_schema is a trove of information about the database. Its format is more or less consistent across the different SQL implementations that are available. Here we explore some of what’s available using several different methods. Postgres stores a lot of metadata. 11.2.2 Contents of the information_schema For this chapter R needs the dbplyr package to access alternate schemas. A schema is an object that contains one or more tables. Most often there will be a default schema, but to access the metadata, you need to explicitly specify which schema contains the data you want. 11.2.3 What tables are in the database? The simplest way to get a list of tables is with table_list &lt;- DBI::dbListTables(con) kable(table_list) x actor_info customer_list film_list nicer_but_slower_film_list sales_by_film_category staff sales_by_store staff_list category film_category country actor language inventory payment rental city store film address film_actor customer 11.2.4 Digging into the information_schema We usually need more detail than just a list of tables. Most SQL databases have an information_schema that has a standard structure to describe and control the database. The information_schema is in a different schema from the default, so to connect to the tables table in the information_schema we connect to the database in a different way: table_info_schema_table &lt;- tbl(con, dbplyr::in_schema(&quot;information_schema&quot;, &quot;tables&quot;)) The information_schema is large and complex and contains 210 tables. So it’s easy to get lost in it. This query retrieves a list of the tables in the database that includes additional detail, not just the name of the table. table_info &lt;- table_info_schema_table %&gt;% filter(table_schema == &quot;public&quot;) %&gt;% select(table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, table_type) %&gt;% arrange(table_type, table_name) %&gt;% collect() kable(table_info) table_catalog table_schema table_name table_type dvdrental public actor BASE TABLE dvdrental public address BASE TABLE dvdrental public category BASE TABLE dvdrental public city BASE TABLE dvdrental public country BASE TABLE dvdrental public customer BASE TABLE dvdrental public film BASE TABLE dvdrental public film_actor BASE TABLE dvdrental public film_category BASE TABLE dvdrental public inventory BASE TABLE dvdrental public language BASE TABLE dvdrental public payment BASE TABLE dvdrental public rental BASE TABLE dvdrental public staff BASE TABLE dvdrental public store BASE TABLE dvdrental public actor_info VIEW dvdrental public customer_list VIEW dvdrental public film_list VIEW dvdrental public nicer_but_slower_film_list VIEW dvdrental public sales_by_film_category VIEW dvdrental public sales_by_store VIEW dvdrental public staff_list VIEW In this context table_catalog is synonymous with `database `. Notice that VIEWS are composites made up of one or more BASE TABLES. The SQL world has its own terminology. For example rs is shorthand for result set. That’s equivalent to using df for a data frame. The following SQL query returns the same information as the previous one. rs &lt;- dbGetQuery( con, &quot;select table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, table_type from information_schema.tables where table_schema not in (&#39;pg_catalog&#39;,&#39;information_schema&#39;) order by table_type, table_name ;&quot; ) kable(rs) table_catalog table_schema table_name table_type dvdrental public actor BASE TABLE dvdrental public address BASE TABLE dvdrental public category BASE TABLE dvdrental public city BASE TABLE dvdrental public country BASE TABLE dvdrental public customer BASE TABLE dvdrental public film BASE TABLE dvdrental public film_actor BASE TABLE dvdrental public film_category BASE TABLE dvdrental public inventory BASE TABLE dvdrental public language BASE TABLE dvdrental public payment BASE TABLE dvdrental public rental BASE TABLE dvdrental public staff BASE TABLE dvdrental public store BASE TABLE dvdrental public actor_info VIEW dvdrental public customer_list VIEW dvdrental public film_list VIEW dvdrental public nicer_but_slower_film_list VIEW dvdrental public sales_by_film_category VIEW dvdrental public sales_by_store VIEW dvdrental public staff_list VIEW 11.3 What columns do those tables contain? Of course, the DBI package has a dbListFields function that provides the simplest way to get the minimum, a list of column names: DBI::dbListFields(con, &quot;rental&quot;) ## [1] &quot;rental_id&quot; &quot;rental_date&quot; &quot;inventory_id&quot; &quot;customer_id&quot; ## [5] &quot;return_date&quot; &quot;staff_id&quot; &quot;last_update&quot; But the information_schema has a lot more useful information that we can use. columns_info_schema_table &lt;- tbl(con, dbplyr::in_schema(&quot;information_schema&quot;, &quot;columns&quot;)) Since the information_schema contains 1855 columns, we are narrowing our focus to just one table. This query retrieves more information about the rental table: columns_info_schema_info &lt;- columns_info_schema_table %&gt;% filter(table_schema == &quot;public&quot;) %&gt;% select( table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, column_name, data_type, ordinal_position, character_maximum_length, column_default, numeric_precision, numeric_precision_radix ) %&gt;% collect(n = Inf) %&gt;% mutate(data_type = case_when( data_type == &quot;character varying&quot; ~ paste0(data_type, &#39; (&#39;, character_maximum_length, &#39;)&#39;), data_type == &quot;real&quot; ~ paste0(data_type, &#39; (&#39;, numeric_precision, &#39;,&#39;, numeric_precision_radix,&#39;)&#39;), TRUE ~ data_type) ) %&gt;% filter(table_name == &quot;rental&quot;) %&gt;% select(-table_schema, -numeric_precision, -numeric_precision_radix) glimpse(columns_info_schema_info) ## Observations: 7 ## Variables: 7 ## $ table_catalog &lt;chr&gt; &quot;dvdrental&quot;, &quot;dvdrental&quot;, &quot;dvdrental&quot;... ## $ table_name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;rental&quot;, &quot;rental&quot;, &quot;rental&quot;, &quot;rental... ## $ column_name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;rental_id&quot;, &quot;rental_date&quot;, &quot;inventor... ## $ data_type &lt;chr&gt; &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;timestamp without time zo... ## $ ordinal_position &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ## $ character_maximum_length &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA ## $ column_default &lt;chr&gt; &quot;nextval(&#39;rental_rental_id_seq&#39;::regc... kable(columns_info_schema_info) table_catalog table_name column_name data_type ordinal_position character_maximum_length column_default dvdrental rental rental_id integer 1 NA nextval(‘rental_rental_id_seq’::regclass) dvdrental rental rental_date timestamp without time zone 2 NA NA dvdrental rental inventory_id integer 3 NA NA dvdrental rental customer_id smallint 4 NA NA dvdrental rental return_date timestamp without time zone 5 NA NA dvdrental rental staff_id smallint 6 NA NA dvdrental rental last_update timestamp without time zone 7 NA now() 11.3.1 What is the difference between a VIEW and a BASE TABLE?

Tables and columns may or may not be named consistently or in a way that makes sense to you. You should look at these names as data. 11.4.1 Counting columns and name reuse Pull out some rough-and-ready but useful statistics about your database.

Your DBA will create your user accounts and priviledges for the database(s) that you can access. One of the challenges when working with a database(s) is finding where your data actually resides. Your best resources will be one or more subject matter experts, SME, and your DBA. Your data may actually reside in multiple databases, e.g., a detail and summary databases. In our tutorial, we focus on the one database, dvdrental. Database names usually reflect something about the data that they contain. Your laptop is a server for the Docker Postgres databases. A database is a collection of files that Postgres manages in the background. 12.2 How many databases reside in the Docker Container? rs &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery( con, &quot;SELECT &#39;DB Names in Docker&#39; showing ,datname DB FROM pg_database WHERE datistemplate = false; &quot; ) kable(rs) showing db DB Names in Docker postgres DB Names in Docker dvdrental Which databases are available?

This is a common practice in organinzations that have implemented single sign on across their organization. Gotcha: If one has data in multiple databases or multiple environments, Development, Integration, and Prodution, it is very easy to connect to the wrong database in the wrong environment. Always double check your connection information when logging in and before performing any inserts, updates, or deletes against the database. The following code block should be used to reduce propagating the above gotcha. Current_database(), CURRENT_DATE or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, and ‘result set’ are the most useful and last three not so much. Instead of the host IP address having the actual hostname would be a nice addition. rs1 &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery( con, &quot;SELECT current_database() DB ,CURRENT_DATE ,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ,&#39;result set description&#39; showing ,session_user ,inet_server_addr() host ,inet_server_port() port &quot; ) kable(display_rows) x 5 Since we will only be working in the dvdrental database in this tutorial and reduce the number of output columns shown, only the ‘result set description’ will be used. 12.3 Which Schema? In the code block below, we look at the information_schema.table which contains information about all the schemas and table/views within our dvdrental database. Databases can have one or more schemas, containers that hold tables or views. Schemas partition the database into big logical blocks of related data. Schema names usually reflect an application or logically related datasets. Occasionally a DBA will set up a new schema and use a users name. What schemas are in the dvdrental database? How many entries are in each schema? ## Database Schemas # rs1 &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery( con, &quot;SELECT &#39;DB Schemas&#39; showing,t.table_catalog DB,t.table_schema,COUNT(*) tbl_vws FROM information_schema.tables t GROUP BY t.table_catalog,t.table_schema &quot; ) kable(rs1) showing db table_schema tbl_vws DB Schemas dvdrental pg_catalog 121 DB Schemas dvdrental public 22 DB Schemas dvdrental information_schema 67 We see that there are three schemas. The pg_catalog is the standard PostgreSQL meta data and core schema. Postgres uses this schema to manage the internal workings of the database. DBA’s are the primary users of pg_catalog. We used the pg_catalog schema to answer the question ‘How many databases reside in the Docker Container?’, but normally the data analyst is not interested in analyzing database data. The information_schema contains ANSI standardized views used across the different SQL vendors, (Oracle, Sysbase, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, etc). The information_schema contains a plethora of metadata that will help you locate your data tables, understand the relationships between the tables, and write efficient SQL queries. 12.4 Exercises # # Add an order by clause to order the output by the table catalog. rs1 &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery(con,&quot;SELECT &#39;1.

It is a database language where we can perform certain operations on the existing database and we can use it create a new database. There are four main categories where the SQL commands fall into: DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL. ##Data Definition Langauge (DDL) It consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define database schema. The DDL commands include: 1. CREATE 2. ALTER 3. TRUNCATE 4. COMMENT 5. RENAME 6. DROP ##Data Manipulation Langauge (DML) These four SQL commands deals with the manipulation of data in the database. 1. SELECT 2. INSERT 3. UPDATE 4. DELETE ##Data Control Language (DCL) The DCL commands deals with user’s rights, permissions and other controls in database management system. 1. GRANT 2. REVOKE ##Transaction Control Language (TCL) These commands deals with the control over transaction within the database. Transaction combines a set of tasks into single execution. 1. SET TRANSACTION 2. SAVEPOINT 3. ROLLBACK 4. COMMIT "],
