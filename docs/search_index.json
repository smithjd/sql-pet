Edward (Ed) Borasky, Scott Case, and Sophie Yang 2018-10-01 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Using R to query a DBMS in your organization Large data stores in organizations are stored in databases that have specific access constraints and structural characteristics. Data documentation may be incomplete, often emphasizes operational issues rather than analytic ones, and often needs to be confirmed on the fly. Data volumes and query performance are important design constraints. R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures and coding schemes to address incompletely formed questions so that exploratory data analysis has to be fast. Exploratory techniques for the purpose should not be reinvented (and so would benefit from more public instruction or discussion). Learning to navigate the interfaces (passwords, packages, etc.) between R and a database is difficult to simulate outside corporate walls. Resources for interface problem diagnosis behind corporate walls may or may not address all the issues that R users face, so a simulated environment is needed. 1.2 Docker as a tool for UseRs Noam Ross’s “Docker for the UseR” suggests that there are four distinct Docker use-cases for useRs. Make a fixed working environment for reproducible analysis Access a service outside of R (e.g., Postgres) Create an R based service (e.g., with plumber) Send our compute jobs to the cloud with minimal reconfiguration or revision This book explores #2 because it allows us to work on the database access issues described above and to practice on an industrial-scale DBMS. Docker is a relatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/RStudio session and a database – all on on a single machine, provided you have Docker installed and running. You may want to run PostgreSQL on a Docker container, avoiding any OS or system dependencies that might come up. 1.3 Docker and R on your machine Here is how R and Docker fit on your operating system in this tutorial: (This diagram needs to be updated as our directory structure evolves.) 1.4 Who are we? M. Edward (Ed) Borasky - @znmeb John David Smith - @smithjd Scott Came - @scottcame Ian Franz - @ianfrantz Sophie Yang - @SophieMYang Jim Tyhurst - @jimtyhurst 1.5 Prerequisites You will need: A computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux (Any Linux distro that will run Docker Community Edition, R and RStudio will work), R, and RStudio and Docker hosting. The database we use is PostgreSQL 10, but you do not need to install that - it’s installed via a Docker image. RStudio 1.2 is highly recommended but not required. In addition to the current version of R and RStudio, you will need the following packages: tidyverse DBI RPostgres glue dbplyr 1.6 Install Docker Install Docker. Installation depends on your operating system: On a Mac On UNIX flavors For Windows, consider these issues and follow these instructions. 1.7 Download the repo First step: download this repo. It contains source code to build a Docker container that has the dvdrental database in PostgreSQL and shows how to interact with the database from R. "],
["docker-hosting-for-windows-02.html", "Chapter 2 Docker Hosting for Windows (02) 2.1 Hardware requirements 2.2 Software requirements 2.3 Docker for Windows settings 2.4 Git, GitHub and line endings", " Chapter 2 Docker Hosting for Windows (02) Skip these instructions if your computer has either OSX or a Unix variant. 2.1 Hardware requirements You will need an Intel or AMD processor with 64-bit hardware and the hardware virtualization feature. Most machines you buy today will have that, but older ones may not. You will need to go into the BIOS / firmware and enable the virtualization feature. You will need at least 4 gigabytes of RAM! 2.2 Software requirements You will need Windows 7 64-bit or later. If you can afford it, I highly recommend upgrading to Windows 10 Pro. 2.2.1 Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 Home (64 bit) Install Docker Toolbox. The instructions are here: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/. Make sure you try the test cases and they work! 2.2.2 Windows 10 Pro Install Docker for Windows stable. The instructions are here: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#start-docker-for-windows. Again, make sure you try the test cases and they work. 2.3 Docker for Windows settings 2.3.1 Shared drives If you’re going to mount host files into container file systems (as we do in the following chapters), you need to set up shared drives. Open the Docker settings dialog and select Shared Drives. Check the drives you want to share. In this screenshot, the D: drive is my 1 terabyte hard drive. 2.3.2 Kubernetes Kubernetes is a container orchestration / cloud management package that’s a major DevOps tool. It’s heavily supported by Red Hat and Google, and as a result is becoming a required skill for DevOps. However, it’s overkill for this project at the moment. So you should make sure it’s not enabled. Go to the Kubernetes dialog and make sure the Enable Kubernetes checkbox is cleared. 2.4 Git, GitHub and line endings Git was originally developed for Linux - in fact, it was created by Linus Torvalds to manage hundreds of different versions of the Linux kernel on different machines all around the world. As usage has grown, it’s achieved a huge following and is the version control system used by most large open source projects, including this one. If you’re on Windows, there are some things about Git and GitHub you need to watch. First of all, there are quite a few tools for running Git on Windows, but the RStudio default and recommended one is Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win). By default, text files on Linux end with a single linefeed (\\n) character. But on Windows, text files end with a carriage return and a line feed (\\r\\n). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline for the gory details. Git defaults to checking files out in the native mode. So if you’re on Linux, a text file will show up with the Linux convention, and if you’re on Windows, it will show up with the Windows convention. Most of the time this doesn’t cause any problems. But Docker containers usually run Linux, and if you have files from a repository on Windows that you’ve sent to the container, the container may malfunction or give weird results. This kind of situation has caused a lot of grief for contributors to this project, so beware. In particular, executable sh or bash scripts will fail in a Docker container if they have Windows line endings. You may see an error message with \\r in it, which means the shell saw the carriage return (\\r) and gave up. But often you’ll see no hint at all what the problem was. So you need a way to tell Git that some files need to be checked out with Linux line endings. See https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/ for the details. Summary: You’ll need a .gitattributes file in the root of the repository. In that file, all text files (scripts, program source, data, etc.) that are destined for a Docker container will need to have the designator &lt;spec&gt; text eol=lf, where &lt;spec&gt; is the file name specifier, for example, *.sh. This repo includes a sample: .gitattributes "],

(03) 3.2 Learning Goals 3.3 Use cases 3.4 Environment", " Chapter 3 Learning Goals and Use Cases 3.1 Context: Why integrate R with databases using Docker? (03) Large data stores in organizations are stored in databases that have specific access constraints and structural characteristics. Learning to navigate the gap between R and the database is difficult to simulate outside corporate walls. R users frequently need to make sense of complex data structures using diagnostic techniques that should not be reinvented (and so would benefit from more public instruction and commentary). Docker is a relatively easy way to simulate the relationship between an R/Rstudio session and database – all on on a single machine. 3.2 Learning Goals After working through this tutorial, you can expect to be able to: Run queries against PostgreSQL in an environment that simulates what you will find in a corporate setting. Understand some of the trade offs between queries aimed at exploration or informal investigation using dplyr and those where performance is important because of the size of the database or the frequency with which a query is run. You will be able to rewrite dplyr queries as SQL and submit them directly. You will have some understanding of techniques for assessing query structure and performance. Set up a PostgreSQL database in a Docker environment and understand enough about Docker to swap databases, swap DBMS’ (e.g., MySQL for PostgreSQL, etc.) 3.3 Use cases Imagine that you have one of several roles at DVDs R Us and that you need to: As a data scientist, I want to know the distribution of number of rentals per month per customer, so that the Marketing department can create incentives for customers in 3 segments: Frequent Renters, Average Renters, Infrequent Renters. As the Director of Sales, I want to see the total number of rentals per month for the past 6 months and I want to know how fast our customer base is growing/shrinking per month for the past 6 months. As the Director of Marketing, I want to know which categories of DVDs are the least popular, so that I can create a campaign to draw attention to rarely used inventory. As a shipping clerk, I want to add rental information when I fulfill a shipment order. As the Director of Analytics, you want to test as much of the production R code in my shop against a new release of the DBMS that the IT department is implementing next month. etc. 3.4 Environment This tutorial uses the Postgres version of “dvd rental” database, which can be downloaded here. Here’s a glimpse of it’s structure: Entity Relationship diagram for the dvdrental database "],

The parameters or commands that are being sent stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE are two parameters that are standard in this book, so that the command’s full output is shown in the book.

The following chunk just constructs the command, but does not execute it. If you have problems executing a command, you can always copy the command and execute in your terminal session. docker_cmd &lt;- glue( &quot;run &quot;, # Run is the Docker command. Everything that follows are `docker run` parameters. &quot;--detach &quot;, # (or `-d`) tells Docker to disconnect from the terminal / program issuing the command &quot;--name cattle &quot;, # tells Docker to give the container a name: `cattle` &quot;--publish 5432:5432 &quot;, # tells Docker to expose the Postgres port 5432 to the local network with 5432 &quot; postgres:10 &quot; # tells Docker the image that is to be run (after downloading if necessary) ) # We name containers `cattle` for &quot;throw-aways&quot; and `pet` for ones we treasure and keep around. :-) Submit the command constructed above: # this is what you would submit from a terminal: cat(glue(&quot; docker &quot;, docker_cmd)) ## docker run --detach --name cattle --publish 5432:5432 postgres:10 # this is how R submits it to Docker: system2(&quot;docker&quot;, docker_cmd, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;6fa7568b0e4cefc02a15158b02f781678be4c5fb8b494fd47567efadfad9ea35&quot; Docker returns a long string of numbers. If you are running this command for the first time, Docker downloads the PostgreSQL image, which takes a bit of time.

PostgreSQL can take different amounts of time to come up and be ready to accept connections from R, depending on various factors that will be discussed later on. #&#39; Connect to Postgres, waiting if it is not ready #&#39; #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @param user Username that will be found #&#39; @param password Password that corresponds to the username #&#39; @param dbname the name of the database in the database #&#39; @param seconds_to_test the number of iterations to try while waiting for Postgres to be ready #&#39; wait_for_postgres &lt;- function(user, password, dbname, seconds_to_test = 10) { for (i in 1:seconds_to_test) { db_ready &lt;- DBI::dbCanConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), host = &quot;localhost&quot;, port = &quot;5432&quot;, user = user, password = password, dbname = dbname) if ( !db_ready ) {Sys.sleep(1)} else {con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), host = &quot;localhost&quot;, port = &quot;5432&quot;, user = user, password = password, dbname = dbname) } if (i == seconds_to_test &amp; !db_ready) {con &lt;- &quot;There is no connection&quot;} } con } When we call wait_for_postgres we’ll use environment variables that R obtains from reading a file named .Rprofile. That file is not uploaded to Github and R looks for it in your default directory. To see whether you have already created that file, execute: dir(path = &quot;~&quot;, pattern = &quot;.Rprofile&quot;, all.files = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;.Rprofile&quot; It should contain lines such as: DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME=postgres Those are the default values for the username and password, but this approach demonstrates how they would be kept secret and not uploaded to Github or some other public location. This is how the wait_for_postgres function is used: con &lt;- wait_for_postgres(user = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME&quot;), password = Sys.getenv(&quot;DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD&quot;), dbname = &quot;postgres&quot;, seconds_to_test = 10) Show that you can connect but that PostgreSQL database doesn’t contain any tables: dbListTables(con) ## character(0) 4.3.2 Alternative: put the database password in an environment file The goal is to put the password in an untracked file that will not be committed in your source code repository. Your code can reference the name of the variable, but the value of that variable will not appear in open text in your source code. We have chosen to call the file dev_environment.csv in the current working directory where you are executing this script. That file name appears in the .gitignore file, so that you will not accidentally commit it. We are going to create that file now. You will be prompted for the database password. By default, a PostgreSQL database defines a database user named postgres, whose password is postgres. If you have changed the password or created a new user with a different password, then enter those new values when prompted. Otherwise, enter postgres and postgres at the two prompts. In an interactive environment, you could execute a snippet of code that prompts the user for their username and password with the following snippet (which isn’t run in the book): prompt_for_postgres &lt;- function(seconds_to_test){ for (i in 1:seconds_to_test) { db_ready &lt;- DBI::dbCanConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), host = &quot;localhost&quot;, port = &quot;5432&quot;, user = dplyr::filter(environment_variables, variable == &quot;username&quot;)[, &quot;value&quot;], password = dplyr::filter(environment_variables, variable == &quot;password&quot;)[, &quot;value&quot;], dbname = &quot;postgres&quot;) if ( !db_ready ) {Sys.sleep(1)} else {con &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), host = &quot;localhost&quot;, port = &quot;5432&quot;, user = dplyr::filter(environment_variables, variable == &quot;username&quot;)[, &quot;value&quot;], password = dplyr::filter(environment_variables, variable == &quot;password&quot;)[, &quot;value&quot;], dbname = &quot;postgres&quot;) } if (i == seconds_to_test &amp; !db_ready) {con &lt;- &quot;there is no connection &quot;} } con } DB_USERNAME &lt;- trimws(readline(prompt = &quot;username: &quot;), which = &quot;both&quot;) DB_PASSWORD &lt;- getPass::getPass(msg = &quot;password: &quot;) environment_variables = data.frame( variable = c(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;), value = c(DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) write.csv(environment_variables, &quot;./dev_environment.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) Your password is still in plain text in the file, dev_environment.csv, so you should protect that file from exposure. However, you do not need to worry about committing that file accidentally to your git repository, because the name of the file appears in the .gitignore file. For security, we use values from the environment_variables data.frame, rather than keeping the username and password in plain text in a source file. 4.3.3 Interact with Postgres Write mtcars to PostgreSQL dbWriteTable(con, &quot;mtcars&quot;, mtcars, overwrite = TRUE) List the tables in the PostgreSQL database to show that mtcars is now there: dbListTables(con) ## [1] &quot;mtcars&quot; # list the fields in mtcars: dbListFields(con, &quot;mtcars&quot;) ## [1] &quot;mpg&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; &quot;wt&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;gear&quot; ## [11] &quot;carb&quot; Download the table from the DBMS to a local data frame: mtcars_df &lt;- tbl(con, &quot;mtcars&quot;) # Show a few rows: knitr::kable(head(mtcars_df)) mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 4.4 Clean up Afterwards, always disconnect from the DBMS, stop the docker container and (optionally) remove it. dbDisconnect(con) # tell Docker to stop the container: system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;stop cattle&quot;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;cattle&quot; # Tell Docker to remove the container from it&#39;s library of active containers: system2(&quot;docker&quot;, &quot;rm cattle&quot;, stdout = TRUE, stderr = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;cattle&quot; If we stop the docker container but don’t remove it (with the rm cattle command), the container will persist and we can start it up again later with start cattle. In that case, mtcars would still be there and we could retrieve it from R again. Since we have now removed the cattle container, the whole database has been deleted. (There are enough copies of mtcars in the world, so no great loss.) "],

The first time it runs it will take a minute to create the PostgreSQL environment. There are two important parts to this that may not be obvious: The source= parameter points to dvdrental.Dockerfile, which does most of the heavy lifting. It has detailed, line-by-line comments to explain what it is doing. Inside dvdrental.Dockerfile the command COPY init-dvdrental.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ copies init-dvdrental.sh from the local file system into the specified location in the Docker container. When the PostgreSQL Docker container initializes, it looks for that file and executes it. Doing all of that work behind the scenes involves two layers of complexity. Depending on how you look at it, that may be more or less difficult to understand than the method shown in the next Chapter. wd &lt;- getwd() docker_cmd &lt;- glue( &quot;run &quot;, # Run is the Docker command.

In the tutorial, fully constructed docker commands are printed out and then executed. If for some reason the executed docker command fails, one can copy and paste it into your local terminal window to see additional error information. Failures seem more prevalent in the Windows environment. 15.2 Communicating with Docker Applications In this tutorial, the two main ways to interface with the applications in the Docker container are through the CLI or the RStudio system2 command. The blue box in the diagram above represents these two interfaces. "]
