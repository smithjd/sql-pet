# This Book's Learning Goals and Use Cases (03)


## Learning Goals

After working through this tutorial, you can expect to be able to:

* Set up a PostgreSQL database in a Docker environment.
* Run queries against PostgreSQL in an environment that simulates what you will find in a corporate setting.
* Understand techniques and some of the trade-offs between:
    1. queries aimed at exploration or informal investigation using [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr); and 
    2. those where performance is important because of the size of the database or the frequency with which a query is run.
* Understand the equivalence between `dplyr` and SQL queries and how R translates one into the other
* Understand some more advanced SQL techniques.
* Gain familiarity with the standard metadata that an SQL database contains to describe its own contents.
* Gain some understanding of techniques for assessing query structure and performance.
* Understand enough about Docker to swap databases, e.g. [Sports DB](http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/samples) for the [DVD rental database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) used in this tutorial. Or swap the database management system (DBMS), e.g. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Imaging a DVD rental business

* Years ago people rented videos on DVD disks and video stores were a big business.
* Imagine managing a video rental store [like Movie Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_Madness_Video) in Portland, Oregon.

* What data would be needed and what questions would you have to answer about the business?

This tutorial uses [the Postgres version of "dvd rental" database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) which represents the transaction database for running a movie (e.g., dvd) rental business.  The database can be  [downloaded here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dvdrental.zip).  Here's a glimpse of it's structure, which will be discussed in some detail:

A data analyst uses the database abstraction and the practical business questions to answer business questions.

## Use cases 

Imagine that you have one of several roles at our fictional company **DVDs R Us** and that you need to:

* As a data scientist, I want to know the distribution of number of rentals per month per customer, so that the Marketing department can create incentives for customers in 3 segments: Frequent Renters, Average Renters, Infrequent Renters.
* As the Director of Sales, I want to see the total number of rentals per month for the past 6 months and I want to know how fast our customer base is growing/shrinking per month for the past 6 months.
* As the Director of Marketing, I want to know which categories of DVDs are the least popular, so that I can create a campaign to draw attention to rarely used inventory.
* As a shipping clerk, I want to add rental information when I fulfill a shipment order.
* As the Director of Analytics, I want to test as much of the production R code in my shop as possible against a new release of the DBMS that the IT department is implementing next month.
* etc.

## Investigating a question using with an organization's database

* Need both familiarity with the data and a focus question
  + An iterative process where 
    + the data resource can shape your understanding of the question
    + the question you need to answer will frame how your see the data resource
  + You need to go back and forth between the two, asking 
    + do I understand the question?
    + do I understand the data?

* How well do you understand the data resource (in the DBMS)?
  + Use all available documentation and understand its limits
  + Use your own tools and skills to examine the data resource
  + what's *missing* from the database: (columns, records, cells)
  + why is there missing data?
  
* How well do you understand the question you seek to answer?
  + How general or specific is your question?
  + How aligned is it with the purpose for which the database was designed and is being operated?
  + How different are your assumptions and concerns from those of the people who enter and use the data on a day to day basis?
