# SQL Joins exercises {#chapter_sql-joins-answers}

This chapter contains questions one may be curious about or asked about the DVD Rental business.

> The goal of the exercises is extracting useful or questionable insights from one or more tables. Each exercise has some or all of the following parts.
>
> 1. The question.
> 2. The tables used to answer the question.
> 3. A hidden SQL code block showing the desired output. Click the code button to see the SQL code.   
> 4. A table of derived values or renamed columns shown in the SQL block to facilitate replicating the desired dplyr solution.  Abbreviated column names are used to squeeze in more columns into the answer to reduce scrolling across the screen.
> 5. A replication section where you recreate the desired output using dplyr syntax.  Most columns come directly out of the tables.  Each replication code block has three commented function calls:
>    *  sp_tbl_descr('store')        --describes a table, store
>    *  sp_tbl_pk_fk('table_name')   --shows a table's primary and foreign keys
>    *  sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)  --shows table row counts.
> 6. To keep the exercises concentrated on the joins, all derived dates drop their timestamp.
>    *  SQL syntax:   date_column::DATE
>    *  Dplyr syntax: as.date(date_colun)

#  Exercise Instructions

1.  Manually execute all the code blocks up-to the "SQL Union Exercise."  
2.  Most of the exercises can be performed in any order.  
*  There are function exercises that create a function followed by another code block to call the function in the previous exercise.
3.  Use the Show Document Outline, CTL-Shift-O, to navigate to the different exercises.





Verify Docker is up and running:


```r
sp_check_that_docker_is_up()
```

```
## [1] "Docker is up but running no containers"
```

Verify pet DB is available, it may be stopped.


```r
sp_show_all_docker_containers()
```

```
## CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES

```

Start up the `docker-pet` container


```r
sp_docker_start("sql-pet")
```

Now connect to the database with R


```r
# need to wait for Docker & Postgres to come up before connecting.

con <- sp_get_postgres_connection(
  user = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_USER_NAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("DEFAULT_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"),
  dbname = "dvdrental",
  seconds_to_test = 30
)
```

# Dplyr tables

All the tables defined in the DVD Rental System will fit into memory which is rarely the case when working with a database.  Each table is loaded into an R object named TableName_table, via a DBI::dbReadTable call.

*  actor_table <- DBI::dbReadTable(con,"actor")


```r
source(here('book-src', 'dvdrental-table-declarations.R'),echo=FALSE)
```

The following code block deletes and inserts records into the different tables used in the exercises in this chpater.  The techniques used in this code block are discussed in detail in the appendix, ??add link here.??  


```r
source(here('book-src', 'sql_pet_data.R'),echo=FALSE)
```

# SQL Union Exercise

When joining many tables, it is helpful to have the number of rows from each table as an initial sanity check that the joins are returning a reasonable number of rows.

## 1.  How many rows are in each table?


```r
table_rows_sql <- dbGetQuery(
  con,
  "select *
                 from (      select 'actor' tbl_name,count(*) from actor 
                       union select 'category' tbl_name,count(*) from category
                       union select 'film' tbl_name,count(*) from film
                       union select 'film_actor' tbl_name,count(*) from film_actor
                       union select 'film_category' tbl_name,count(*) from film_category
                       union select 'language' tbl_name,count(*) from language
                       union select 'inventory' tbl_name,count(*) from inventory
                       union select 'rental' tbl_name,count(*) from rental
                       union select 'payment' tbl_name,count(*) from payment
                       union select 'staff' tbl_name,count(*) from staff
                       union select 'customer' tbl_name,count(*) from customer
                       union select 'address' tbl_name,count(*) from address
                       union select 'city' tbl_name,count(*) from city
                       union select 'country' tbl_name,count(*) from country
                       union select 'store' tbl_name,count(*) from store
                       ) counts
                  order by tbl_name
                 ;
                "
)
sp_print_df(table_rows_sql)
```

### 3. How Many Active, Inactive, and Total Customers Does the DVD Rental Business Have?

To answer this question we look at the `customer` table.  In a previous chapter we observed that there are two columns, `activebool` and `active`.  We consider `active = 1` as active.


```r
customer_cnt_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"SELECT sum(case when active = 1 then 1 else 0 end) active
       ,sum(case when active = 0 then 1 else 0 end) inactive
       ,count(*) total
   from customer
")

sp_print_df(customer_cnt_sql)
```

Based on the table above, the DVD Rental business has customers in 118 countries.  The DVD Rental business cannot have many walk in customers.  It may possibly use a mail order distribution model.

For an international company, how are the different currencies converted to a standard currency?  Looking at the ERD, there is no currency conversion rate.</font>

### 5 What Countries Constitute the Top 25% of the Customer Base?

Using the previous code, add two new columns.  One column shows a running total and the second column shows a running percentage.  Order the data by count then by country.

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `address`, `city`, and `country` tables again.


```r
country_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
                            
"select active,country,count
       ,sum(count) over (order by count desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_total
       , pct
       ,sum(pct) over (order by pct desc,country rows between unbounded preceding and current row) running_pct
  from (-- Start of inner SQL Block
        select c.active,country.country,count(*) count
              ,round(100 * count(*) / sum(count(*)) over(),4) as pct
         from customer c
              join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
              join city  on a.city_id = city.city_id
              join country on city.country_id = country.country_id
         group by c.active,country
       ) ctry  -- End of inner SQL Block

### 7. How Many Languages?

With an international customer base, how many languages does the DVD Rental business distribute DVD's in.

To answer this question we look at the `language` table.


```r
languages_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"
select * from language
")

sp_print_df(languages_sql)
```

To answer this question we look at the `language` and `film` tables.


```r

### 9.  What are the number of rentals and rented amount by store, by month?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to answer this question. 


```r

### 11 What is the rental distribution/DVD for the top two rented films?

From the previous exercise we know that the top two films are `Bucket Brotherhood` and `Rocketeer Mother`.  

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `inventory`, and `film` tables again.  

Instead of looking at the film level, we need to drill down to the individual dvd's for each film to answer this question.



```r
film_rank2_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
"select i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id,count(*) 
   from rental r join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
        join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
  where i.film_id in (103,738)
group by i.store_id,i.film_id,f.title,i.inventory_id")

sp_print_df(film_rank2_sql)
```

### 27.  Who are the top-n1 and bottom-n2 customers?

The issue with the two previous reports is that the top end is hardcoded, rentals  > 40.  Over time, the current customers will always be in the top section and new customers will get added.  Another way of looking at the previous report is to show just the top and bottom 5 customers.  

Parameterize the previous exercise to show the top 5 and bottom 5 customers. 

To answer this question we look at the `customer`, `rental`, and `payments` tables again.

The next code block executes a sql version of such a function.  With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 5, it replicates the hard coded version of the previous exercise. With top_n = 5 and bot_n = 0, it gives a top 5 report.  With top_n = 0 and bot_n = 5, the report returns the bottom 5.  Change the two parameters to see the output from the different combinations.


```r

### 29.  What is the business' distribution of payments?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `payment`, `inventory`, and `film` tables to answer this question.

As a sanity check, we first check the number of rentals and amount payments.

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

This table describes the columns in the code block answer that follows.  There are payment records where the charged amount, rental rate, is less than the amount paid.  These payments are split into two pieces, rate_lt_paid and rate_lt_over_paid.  The rate_lt_paid is rental rate amount.  The rate_lt_over_paid is the paid amount - rental rate, the over paid amount.

### 31. What is the business cash flow?

In the previous exercise we saw that about 50% of the rentals collected the correct amount and 40% of the rentals over collected.  The last 10% were never collected.

Calculate the number of days it took before the payment was collected and the amount collected?

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `customer`, `payment`, `inventory`, `payment` and `film` tables to answer this question.

### 32.  Customer information

Create a function that takes a customer id and returns

*  customer address information
*  films rented and returned information
*  customer payment information

The hidden code block implements such a function in SQL.

To answer this question we look at the `rental`, `customer`, `address`, `city, `country`, `inventory`, `payment` and `film` tables to answer this question.  


```r
customer_details_fn_sql <- function(cust_id) {
    customer_details_sql <- dbGetQuery(con,
    "select c.customer_id id,concat(first_name,' ',c.last_name) customer
          ,c.email,a.phone,a.address,address2,city.city,a.postal_code,ctry.country
          ,c.store_id cust_store_id
          ,i.store_id inv_store_id
          ,f.film_id
          ,f.title
          ,r.rental_date::date rented
          ,r.return_date::date returned
          ,(r.rental_date + INTERVAL '1 day'  * f.rental_duration)::date exp_rtn_dt
          ,case when r.return_date is null
                then null
                else r.return_date::date  - (r.rental_date + INTERVAL '1 day'  * f.rental_duration)::date
           end rtn_stat
          ,case when r.rental_id is null
                then null
                      -- dvd returned             
                when r.return_date is null
                then 1
                else 0
           end not_rtn
          ,payment_date::date pay_dt
          ,f.rental_rate charges
          ,p.amount paid
          ,p.amount-f.rental_rate delta
          ,p.staff_id pay_staff_id
          ,payment_date::date - rental_date::date pay_days
          ,r.rental_id,i.inventory_id,payment_id
      from customer c left join rental r on c.customer_id = r.customer_id
                      left join address a on c.address_id = a.address_id
                      left join city on city.city_id = a.city_id
                      left join country ctry on ctry.country_id = city.country_id
                      left join inventory i on r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
                      left join payment p on c.customer_id = p.customer_id and p.rental_id = r.rental_id
                      left join film f on i.film_id = f.film_id
     where c.customer_id = $1
    order by id,rented desc
    "
    ,cust_id
    )
    return(customer_details_sql)
}
```

The following code block executes the customer function. Change the `cust_id` value to see differnt customers.


```r
# cust_id <- 600
# sp_print_df( customer_details_fn_sql(cust_id))
```

#### Replicate the output above using dplyr syntax.

Use the following code block to test the dplyr function.


```r
# cust_id <- 601
# sp_print_df(customer_details_fn_dplyr(cust_id))
```

## Different strategies for interacting with the database

select examples

    dbGetQuery returns the entire result set as a data frame.  For large returned datasets, complex or inefficient SQL statements, this may take a long time.

      dbSendQuery: parses, compiles, creates the optimized execution plan.  
          dbFetch: Execute optimzed execution plan and return the dataset.
    dbClearResult: remove pending query results from the database to your R environment

### dbGetQuery Versus dbSendQuery+dbFetch+dbClearResult

How many customers are there in the DVD Rental System?


```r
rs1 <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from customer;")
sp_print_df(head(rs1))
```
