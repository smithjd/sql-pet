## Using a SQL database from R

Focus is R code accessing data in a SQL database

> * Use **RStudio** to facilitate:
>    * R development
>    * Browsing the database
> * Use **Docker** to simplify:
>    * Installing PostgreSQL
>    * Managing PostgreSQL (starting, stopping, re-initializing, ...)

## ... Using a SQL database from R

> * Most of this R code does _not_ depend on:
>     * Location of database: local _or_ remote
>     * Installation strategy: Docker _or_ native
> * So this R code generalizes to:
>     * PostgreSQL running local in Docker
>     * PostgreSQL running from local native install
>     * PostgreSQL running remotely
>     * Other RDBMS

## R
We assume a general familiarity with:

* R
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)
    * [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) verbs
    * pipe operator ([`%>%`](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/))
    * [tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/v059/i10)
    * techniques for [tidying](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) data

## RStudio

Using R code, we will interact with:

> * **Docker**
>     * Set up a Docker image with PostgreSQL
>     * Launch PostgreSQL inside a Docker container
> * **PostgreSQL**
>     * Write `dplyr` commands that operate on a PostgreSQL database
>     * Write `DBI` commands that send SQL queries directly to a PostgreSQL database

## Accessing a relational database

* [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) library
    * `inner_join`, `left_join`, ...
    * Generates [SQL-92 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92) code
* [`DBI`](http://r-dbi.github.io/DBI/) library
    * `dbListTables`, `dbListFields`, `dbReadTable`, `dbExecute`, `dbGetQuery`, ...
    * Accepts embedded native `SQL` code
    * Specific language features of your DBMS
* Dependencies
    * [`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) library: a `dplyr` back-end for databases
    * [`RPostgres`](https://github.com/tomoakin/RPostgreSQL) library: PostgreSQL driver for R

## Tidy data

_To Do_

Tidy data [@Wickham2014] is:

Well-behaved from the point of view of analysis and tools in the Tidyverse [@RStudio2019].  Tidy data is easier to think about and it is usually worthwhile to make the data tidy [@Wickham2018].  Tidy data is roughly equivalent to _third normal form_ as discussed below.

## Design of "normal data"

_To Do_

Data in a database is most often optimized to minimize storage space and increase performance while preserving integrity when adding, changing, or deleting data.  The Wikipedia article on  Database Normalization has a good introduction to the characteristics of "normal" data and the process of re-organizing it to meet those desirable criteria [@Wikipedia2019].  The bottom line is that "data normalization is practical" although there are mathematical arguments for normalization based on the preservation of data integrity.

## Local vs Remote

| Dimension|Local                    | Remote 
|---|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------
|Design purpose|The R environment on your local machine is designed to be flexible and easy to use; ideal for data investigation.|The DBMS environment is designed for large and complex databases where data integrity is more important than flexibility or ease of use.
|Processor power |Your local machine has less memory, speed, and storage than the typical database server. |Database servers are specialized, more expensive, and have more power.
|Memory constraint |In R, query results must fit into memory. |Servers have a lot of memory and write intermediate results to disk if needed without you knowing about it.
|Data crunching |Data lives in the DBMS, so crunching it down locally requires you to pull it over the network.|A DBMS has powerful data crunching capabilities once you know what you want and moves data over the server backbone to crunch it.

## ... Local vs Remote

| Dimension|Local                    | Remote 
|---|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------
|Security|Local control. Whether it is good or not depends on you. |Responsibility of database administrators who set the rules. You play by their rules.
|Storage of intermediate results |Very easy to save a data frame with intermediate results locally. |May require extra privileges to save results in the database.
|Analytical resources |Ecosystem of available R packages  |Extending SQL instruction set involves dbms-specific functions or R pseudo functions
|Collaboration |One person working on a few data.frames. |Many people collaborating on _many_ tables.
