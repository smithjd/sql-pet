Docker Hosting for Windows
================

## Hardware requirements

You will need an Intel or AMD processor with 64-bit hardware and the
hardware virtualization feature. Most machines you buy today will have
that, but older ones may not. You will need to go into the BIOS /
firmware and enable the virtualization feature. You will need at least 4
gigabytes of RAM\!

## Software requirements

You will need Windows 7 64-bit or later. If you can afford it, I highly
recommend upgrading to Windows 10 Pro.

### Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and Windows 10 Home (64 bit)

Install Docker Toolbox. The instructions are here:
<https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/>. Make sure
you try the test cases and they work\!

### Windows 10 Pro

Install Docker for Windows *stable*. The instructions are here:
<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#start-docker-for-windows>.
Again, make sure you try the test cases and they work.
