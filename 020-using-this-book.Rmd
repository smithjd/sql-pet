> * Getting the code used in this book
> * How you can contribute to the book project

This book is full of examples that you can replicate on your computer. 

## Retrieve the code from GitHub

The code to generate the book and the exercises it contains can be downloaded from [this repo](https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet). 

## Read along, experiment as you go

We have never been sure whether we're writing an expository book or a massive tutorial.  You may use it either way.  The best way to learn the material we cover is to *experiment*.

After the introductory chapters and the chapter that [creates the persistent database](#chapter_setup-adventureworks-db), you can jump around and each chapter stands on its own.

## Participating

### Browsing the book
If you just want to read the book and copy / paste code into your working environment, simply browse to <https://smithjd.github.io/sql-pet>. If you get stuck, or find things aren't working, open an issue at <https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/issues/new/>.

### Diving in
If you want to experiment with the code in the book, run it in RStudio and interact with it, you'll need to do two more things:

1. Install the `sqlpetr` R package [@Borasky2018a]. See <https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr> for the package documentation. Installation may take some time if it has to install or update packages not available on your computer.
2. Clone the Git repository <https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet.git> and open the project file `sql-pet.Rproj` in RStudio.

Enjoy!
