## Challenge: goals, context and expectations

* Working behind the corporate firewall -- the need to simulate it.  Important because that's where the data (and possibly your paycheck) are coming from.
* Differences between production and data warehouse environments.  We are simulating a production environment.  There are many similarities.  Data models are different.  Performance is a bigger deal in the OLTP.
* Data in a organizational environment around the database.  Learning to keep your DBAs happy:
  + You are your own DBA in this simulation, so you can wreak havoc and learn from it, but you can learn to be DBA-friendly here.
  + In the end it's the subject-matter experts (people using the data every day) that really understand your data, but you have to work with your DBAs first.
  + You can't believe all the data you pull out of the database.

## The Challenge: Investigating a question using an organization's database

Using an enterprise database to create meaningful management insights requires a combination of very different skills:

* Need both familiarity with the data and a focus question
  + An iterative process where 
    + the data resource can shape your understanding of the question
    + the question you need to answer will frame how you see the data resource
  + You need to go back and forth between the two, asking 
    + do I understand the question?
    + do I understand the data?

* A "good enough" understanding of the data resource (in the DBMS)
  + Nobody knows everything about an entire organization's data resources. We do, however, need to know what more we need to know and estimate what we don't know yet.
  + Use all available documentation and understand its limits
  + Use your own tools and skills to examine the data resource
  + What is *missing* from the database: (columns, records, cells)
  + Why is the data missing?
  
* A "good enough" understanding of the question you seek to answer
  + How general or specific is your question?
  + How aligned is it with the purpose for which the database was designed and is being operated?
  + How different are your assumptions and concerns from those of the people who enter and use the data on a day to day basis?

* Some cycles in this iteration between question refinement and reformulation on the one hand  and data retrieval and investigation on the other feel like a waste time.  That's inevitable. 

* Bringing R tools and skills to bear on these
  + R is a powerful tool for data access, manipulation, modeling and presentation
  + Different R packages and techniques are available for each of the elements involved in exploring, analyzing and reporting on enterprise behavior using the enterprise database.

### Problems that we address in the book

* This book emphasizes database exploration and the R techniques that are needed.
* We are emphasizing a tidyverse approach.  & graphics to really makes sense of what we find.
* We can't call on real people in the adventureworks company, obviously, but we invent some characters to illustrate the investigation process as we have experienced it in various organizational settings.

### Book structure

The book explores R techniques and behaviors using progressively more complex queries, exploring this scenario: There is a new Executive VP of Sales at Adventure Works. She wants an overview of sales and the sales organization's performance at AW.

* Early chapters use just one table from the database: the `salesordedrheader` table in the `sales` schema.  The motivating question might be: "How many sales persons does the _Adventure Works_ company have?"
* Starting with base tables, then use views (that contain knowledge about the application)
* More involved queries join three tables in three different schemas: `salesperson`, `employee`, and `person`. The relevant question might be "Who is my top salesperson?  Are the 3 top salespersons older or younger?"
* Finally, we build a series of queries that explore the sales workflow: sales territories, sales people, top customers by product, product mixture that gives top 80% of sales.  What are they producing in detail?  Seasonal? Type of product, region, etc.?

## Making your way through the book

After working through the code in this book, you can expect to be able to:

* R, SQL and PostgreSQL
  * Run queries against PostgreSQL in an environment that simulates what is found in a corporate setting.
  * Understand techniques and some of the trade-offs between:
      * queries aimed at exploration or informal investigation using [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr)    [@Wickham2018]; and 
      * queries that should be written in SQL, because performance is important due to the size of the database or the frequency  with which a query is to be run.
  * Understand the equivalence between `dplyr` and SQL queries, and how R translates one into the other.
  * Gain familiarity with techniques that help you explore a database and verify its documentation.
  * Gain familiarity with the standard metadata that a SQL database contains to describe its own contents.
  * Understand some advanced SQL techniques.
  * Gain some understanding of techniques for assessing query structure and performance.
* Docker related
  * Set up a PostgreSQL database in a Docker environment. 
  * Gain familiarity with the various ways of interacting with the Docker and PostgreSQL environments
  * Understand enough about Docker to swap databases, e.g. [Sports DB](http://www.sportsdb.org/sd/samples) for the [DVD rental database](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) used in this tutorial. Or swap the database management system (DBMS), e.g. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Adventure Works

In this book we have adopted the Microsoft Adventure Works online transaction processing database for our examples.  It is

See Sections 3 and 4

See the [AdventureWorks Data Dictionary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008/ms124438%28v%3dsql.100%29) and a sample table ([employee](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008/ms124432(v=sql.100))).
