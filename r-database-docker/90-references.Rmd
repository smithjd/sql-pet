## Docker and R
* Noam Ross' [talk on Docker for the UseR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=803oZI5dvAU&t=1) and his [Slides](https://github.com/noamross/nyhackr-docker-talk) give a lot of context and tips.
* Good Docker tutorials
  + [An introductory Docker tutorial](https://docker-curriculum.com/)
  + [A Docker curriculum](https://katacoda.com/courses/docker)
* Scott Came's materials about Docker and R [on his website](http://www.cascadia-analytics.com/2018/07/21/docker-r-p1.html) and at the 2018 UseR Conference focus on **R inside Docker**.
* It's worth studying the [ROpensci Docker tutorial](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/)

## More Resources
* David Severski describes some [key elements of connecting to databases with R](https://github.com/davidski/database_connections) for MacOS users
* This tutorial picks up ideas and tips from Ed Borasky's [Data Science pet containers](https://github.com/hackoregon/data-science-pet-containers), which creates a framework based on that Hack Oregon example and explains why this repo is named pet-sql.
