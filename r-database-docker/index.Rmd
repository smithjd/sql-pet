# Introduction

## Who are we?

* M. Edward (Ed) Borasky - @znmeb
* John David Smith - @smithjd
* Scott Came - @scottcame
* Ian Franz
* Sophie Yang

## Prerequisites
You will need

* A computer running Windows, MacOS, or Linux. Any Linux distro that will run Docker Community Edition, R and RStudio will work,
* R, and
* Docker hosting.

The database we use is PostgreSQL 10, but you do not need to install that - it's installed via a Docker image. RStudio 1.2 is highly recommended but not required.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(),
  'docker',
  'installr',
  'reticulate',
  'keras'
), 'packages.bib')
```
